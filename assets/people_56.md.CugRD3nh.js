On 1 January 2010 the municipality of Ittenthal merged into the municipality of Kaisten. ==History== Archeological finds in Kaisten include a Bronze Age burial mound of the Hallstatt period, and a Roman watchtower and brick kiln. Kaisten is first mentioned in 1282 as Keiston. Ittenthal was first mentioned in 1297 as Utendal though this comes from a 15th-century copy of the original. Ittenthal was also mentioned in 1318 as ze Uttendal. Kaisten castle was built in the 12th and 13th centuries and was part of the territory of S√§ckingen. After the 13th century, it was part of the Austrian Habsburgs land, until 1797. After the annexation of the Fricktal by the Canton of Aargau in the 1803 Act of Mediation it became a municipality. The Church of St. Michael, founded by S√§ckingen, was first mentioned in 1443. Until 1804 it was a filial church of the Laufenburg church. The present building dates from 1717. Before 1812 Kaisten and Ittenthal formed a parish. Economically, vineyards played an important role into the mid-19th century. Throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern age, smelting of iron was also important. In the 20th century, a brick factory was built in Kaisten. Until 1960 Kaisten was mostly a farming village, but it then moved to the chemicals industry. ==Geography== Aerial view (1953) Kaisten has an area, , of .

His friendship with his younger brother Theo was documented in numerous letters they exchanged from August 1872 onwards. The letters were published in three volumes in 1914 by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, Theo's widow, who also generously supported most of the early Van Gogh exhibitions with loans from the artist's estate. Publication of the letters helped spread the compelling mystique of Vincent van Gogh, the intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young, throughout Europe and the rest of the world. His fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I (influencing a whole generation of German artists), and at the end of World War I in Switzerland. Due to the economic crisis in Germany and France after 1918, pioneer collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art which included works by Van Gogh were dissolved. Thus, British and American collectors (private as well as public) had the opportunity to acquire first rate works relatively late. The American novelist Irving Stone published an account of Vincent van Gogh's life in 1934 entitled Lust for Life that was largely based on the letters to Theo; this book and later the movie of the same name added to further the artist's fame.Life Magazine, Vincent van Gogh The Dutch Master of Modern Art has his Greatest American Show, October 10, 1949, pp. 82-87]Retrieved July 2, 2010National Gallery of Art, Washington DC Retrieved July 2, 2010 ==Lifetime exhibits== Flowering Plumtrees at Kameido\\" (1857) and Vincent van Gogh's oil version (1887) During his lifetime, Van Gogh contributed works of his own only on a few and minor occasions which mainly passed unnoted by critics and public. For example, in 1887, a display of Japanese woodcuts in the Restaurant Au Tambourin, 62 Boulevard de Clichy, then run by Augustina S√©gatori,Carol Zemel (1997), ill. p. 186 for which Van Gogh probably interpreted three famous ukiyo-e prints by Keisai Eisen and Hiroshige. Towards the end of this year, he organized another exhibition in the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 Avenue de Clichy, on Montmartre to which his friends √âmile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and evidently Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec contributed. Van Gogh considered the first one a disaster,Beaubourg while he was prepared to take the second one as a success: Bernard and Anquetin sold paintings, and he himself had exchanged works with Paul Gauguin.Letter 510; for the paintings exchanged, see Annet Tellegen, Vincent en Gauguin. Schilderijenruil in Parijs, Museumjournaal 1966, pp. 42-44. There are two short accounts of this exhibition, one based on information supplied by Seurat, and the other one written by √âmile Bernard: :- In 1890, Seurat recalled to have met Vincent there for the first time, \\"in one of these populaire soup kitchens in Avenue de Clichy, now closed. The hall was decorated with his canvases (1887).\\"Vincent Van Gogh - Biography, Quotes & Paintings, retrieved June 14th 2007. :- Already in 1889, at the time of the Volpini Exhibition, √âmile Bernard had prepared a review of Van Gogh's work for Aurier's Moderniste, which was, as this modest paper ceased to appear suddenly, published for the first time a century later, in 1990. In 1888, Van Gogh joined the \\"Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants\\"; so this year three of his paintings were on show in their annual exhibition in Paris, and two in the year following (due to restrictions caused in 1889 by the Exposition Universelle). In 1890 and 1891, their annual exhibitions comprised ten paintings by Vincent; part of them had been shown before by the society \\"Les XX\\" in Brussels, in 1891 completed by a dozen of drawings (some of them only on view \\"by demand\\"). According to letters from his brother Theo, Vincent's contributions to these few exhibitions established his renown amongst French vanguard painters like Claude Monet and Paul Signac. ==Early promoters== Probably it is little more than for curiosity that one of the first mentions of Van Gogh in newspapers was printed in Arles. September 30, 1888, L'Homme de Bronze told its readers :\\"Mr. Vincent, impressionist painter, works in the night, as we are assured, in the glow of the gas lanterns on one of our public places.\\"Roland Dorn 1988, p. 387 Earlier this year, Van Gogh's contribution to the exhibition of the Artists Ind√©pendants has been reviewed. Notes on Van Gogh's exhibits were again published in 1889, amongst them a review by the Dutch painter Joseph Jacob Isaacson, a friend of Meyer de Haan and Theo van Gogh, printed in the 17 August 1889 issue of the Amsterdam weekly De Portefeuille. Vincent felt more troubled than honoured, and asked Isaacson to stop writing about him. But there was no chance to turn the wheel back: January 1890 - in the first issue refounding the Mercure de France - Albert Aurier published his enthusiastic essay 'Les Isol√©s: Vincent van Gogh', on which Vincent's fame as an artist is based as well as Aurier's as a leading art critic. Another voice was that of Octave Mirbeau whose review article 'Vincent van Gogh' in L'√âcho de Paris on 1 March 1891. Later that year Van Gogh's friend √âmile Bernard contributed short pieces on Van Gogh for La Plume and Les Hommes d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui. Julius Meier-Graefe wrote influentially of Van Gogh, his publications including: Entwicklungsgeschichte der modernen Kunst (Stuttgart, 1904 and later Munich 1927), √úber Vincent van Gogh, Sozialistische Monatshefte (February 1906), Vincent van Gogh (Munich 1912), and Van Gogh der Zeichner (Berlin, 1928, published by Otto Wacker). Meier-Graefe also wrote an influential two-volume biography of Van Gogh, published in 1921. In the English-speaking world, the Bloomsbury art critics Roger Fry and Clive Bell were his first champions. Fry, in a 1924 essay, \\"Vincent van Gogh,\\" reported that after Van Gogh's death, he \\"disappeared\\" and \\"scarcely any picture dealer in Bond Street gave him another thought\\" until the 1910 show titled \\"Post Impressionist Exhibition\\" in which \\"his works dazzled, astonished and infuriated all cultured England.\\" Fry's essay canonized Van Gogh as \\"a saint\\" of art, \\"the victim of the terrible intensity of his convictions--his conviction that somewhere one might lay hold of spiritual values compared with which all other values were of no account.\\" His works gave \\"an expression in paint for the desperate violence of his spiritual hunger....\\".Transformations, NY: Doubleday, 1956, pp 235-236 That set the agenda for many subsequent Van Gogh studies, which are predominantly biographical to this day. Van Gogh fits modern culture's attempt to find secular substitutes for a religion it no longer believed in, as M.H. Abrams describes in \\"Natural Supernaturalism\\" (1970). ==Early exhibitions== There were retrospectives in Brussels and Paris in 1891.At Les XX and at the Ind√©pendants During the 1890s, Van Gogh exhibitions were staged in several Dutch and Belgian towns. In 1893, Julien Leclercq brought together a first exhibition featuring Van Gogh, Gauguin and other \\"modernists\\" touring Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Berlin. In 1895 and in 1896 Ambroise Vollard mounted Van Gogh retrospectives in his galleries Rue Lafitte; other minor dealers in Paris had works by Van Gogh continuously on display. In 1901, Leclercq arranged a Van Gogh Exhibition at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris . A little later in the year 1901, the Berlin Secessionists entered the scene, accompanied by the art dealers Bruno Cassirer and especially his cousin Paul, who set the pace for the years to come. In the last days of December, running through January 1902, Paul Cassirer organized the first van Gogh exhibition in Berlin, Germany.The date 1908 proposed in The posthumous fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890-1970, by John Rewald, (first published in Museumjournaal, August‚ÄìSeptember 1970), John Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism, p. 248, published by Abrams 1986, Minor exhibitions of some recently found early works were held in Rotterdam and Amsterdam in 1903 and 1904. Dresden's Br√ºcke group, founded in 1905 by artists Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt- Rottluf, put on a series of exhibitions of Van Gogh's work in Germany in 1905 and 1908, having been introduced to his work by Paul Cassirer. March 5‚Äì22, 1908 Paul Cassirer organized another expo in Berlin which included the painting Peach Blossoms in the Crau lent by Anna Boch. Cassirer first established a market for Van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, controlled market prices. In 1906 Bruno Cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of Vincent's to Theo, translated into German. However, Johanna was keen to maintain her independence, and contributed important loans to Roger Fry's 1910 London exhibition, as well as to the important Sonderbund exhibition of 1912 in Cologne, where Van Gogh was introduced to visitors as \\"the father to us all\\". This was organized by an independent committee of artists, collectors and museum professionals, but was dependent on loans arranged by Cassirer, the Bernheim-Jeune gallery and other art dealers. The first major exhibition from the artist's estate was held in 1892 at the Amsterdam 'Panorama' Building, the next in 1905 at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, followed in 1914 by a display concentrating on Van Gogh's drawings. ==Early private and public collectors== The Red Vineyard, 1888, oil on canvas, 75 √ó 93 cm, Pushkin Museum, Moscow Van Gogh's friends, his colleagues and promoters were at the same time his first collectors. Anna Boch, Paul Gauguin, √âmile Bernard, Toulouse-Lautrec, √âmile Schuffenecker, Edgar Degas as well as Albert Aurier, Octave Mirbeau, Julien Leclercq and Van Eeden - each of them held works by Van Gogh. During the 1890 \\"Les XX\\" expo in Brussels van Gogh sold one of his paintings, The Red Vineyard. It was purchased by Anna Boch, impressionist painter, heiress of a Ceramics fortune and sister of his friend Eugene Boch. Although The Red Vineyard is often said to be the only work of art van Gogh sold during his lifetime, he actually managed to sell at least a couple of other paintings, as well as some drawings. He also exchanged works with other artists and sometimes used them as a payment for food or painting and drawing material. In 1903, the first works of Vincent van Gogh entered museum collections in Vienna and Rotterdam, as well as Folkwang Museum, then privately run by Karl-Ernst Osthaus in Hagen (later transferred to Essen). Little attention was paid at this time to the considerable number of Van Gogh masterpieces already held by the Museum of Modern Art New York (established in 1929), along with the Tate Gallery in London and other British and American galleries. ==Art historians== In 1928, Jacob Baart de la Faille published the first catalogue raisonn√© of Van Gogh's works, comprising paintings as well as drawings and prints (and illustrating almost all of them) ‚Äì a landmark in art history. There has been a reaction against the depiction of Van Gogh as a saint. John Rewald was one of the first to attempt an anti-hagiography; books pointing to Van Gogh's neuroticism have continued since. Counter-claims, particularly based on Van Gogh's three volumes of letters, support Roger Fry's praise.New York: Bulfinch imprint of Little, Brown, 1958, 1978, 1991 ==Forgeries and reattribution== In winter 1927/1928, a problem began that has overshadowed Van Gogh research ever since‚Äîthe emergence of forgeries. Otto Wacker staged an extensive exhibition of drawings by Van Gogh, catalogued and annotated by Julius Meier-Graefe. Then in January 1928, Paul Cassirer opened a large retrospective of paintings, from which two were removed just before the opening, as their authenticity had been questioned. The suspect paintings had been provided by Otto Wacker, and a scandal ensued. In 2007, it was concluded by a team of specialists from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam that the painting Head of a Man, attributed to Van Gogh for over 70 years, was not by him, but was painted by one of his peers. The team determined that the style was inconsistent with Van Gogh's other works, and there was no mention of the painting in any of Van Gogh's known letters. There is no evidence to suggest that the painting was intentionally created as a fake Van Gogh.Would-be Van Gogh Painting is a Fake, Today.com Retrieved 4 August 2007. In February 2010, the Museum de Fundatie in the Dutch city of Zwolle discovered it owned a Van Gogh painting made in 1886, the Le Blute-fin windmill, authenticated ‚Äúbeyond any doubt‚Äù by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The museum's founder Dirk Hannema (1895‚Äì1984), who bought the anonymous painting from a Parisian art dealer in 1975 for 6,500 francs (less than 1,000 euros), was always convinced it was a Van Gogh and insured it for a sum equivalent to 35,000 euros. However, as managing director of Rotterdam‚Äôs Museum Boijmans in 1938, Hannema had purchased a number of paintings that were attributed to Johannes Vermeer, that turned out to be forgeries.\\"Nieuwe Van Gogh ontdekt in Zwolle\\" ==Theft== Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen (1884), painted by van Gogh for his mother Since 1937, when the Nazis confiscated his paintings in Germany, more than 40 of van Gogh's works have been stolen, in at least 15 separate incidents, at galleries across the world. In December 2002, two paintings were stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in a brutal and audacious robbery by experienced, professional thieves. Both of the stolen works were considered important - Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather (1882) was van Gogh's first work in oil and Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen was painted by van Gogh for his mother and later adjusted after the death of his father. The daring raid on the gallery, by professional burglar Octave Durham and an accomplice, took only 3 minutes and 40 seconds. After a gap of some 14 years, both works were eventually recovered, in Castellammare di Stabia, near Pompeii, from Italian Camorra drug-lord Raffaele Imperiale. On February 10, 2008, van Gogh's Blossoming Chestnut Branches, along with three other paintings, valued at more than $163 million, were stolen from the E.G. Buehrle Collection, a private museum in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, by three armed men. ==New painting discovery== On September 9, 2013, the Van Gogh Museum unveiled a long-lost painting that spent years in a Norwegian attic believed to be by another painter. It is the first full-size canvas by him discovered since 1928. Sunset at Montmajour depicts trees, bushes and sky, painted with Van Gogh's familiar thick brush strokes. It can be dated to the exact day it was painted because he described it in a letter to his brother, Theo, and said he painted it the previous day July 4, 1888. ==In popular culture== Van Gogh's life and depression is portrayed in the 1971 song \\"Vincent (Starry Starry Night)\\", written by Don McLean. McLean said that he wrote the song after being moved when reading a biography of van Gogh's hard life. Various aspects of van Gogh's life have been portrayed in several film features including Lust for Life (1956) with Kirk Douglas in the title role, Vincent (1987), Vincent & Theo (1990), Vincent and Me (1990), Dreams (1990), and Van Gogh (1991). Dreams was directed by Akira Kurosawa and featured Martin Scorsese in a vignette portraying van Gogh during his last year while painting wheat fields. At Eternity's Gate (2018) is a drama film about the final days of the painter. It is directed by Julian Schnabel and stars Willem Dafoe as van Gogh. For his performance, Dafoe received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama In the British science fiction series Doctor Who, van Gogh is portrayed by Scottish actor Tony Curran. Upon release, \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" (one of two episodes in which van Gogh appears) received critical acclaim with many praising Curran's portrayal of the artist. Loving Vincent is a 2017 experimental animated biographical drama film about van Gogh's life and in particular, the circumstances surrounding his death. The world's first fully painted feature film, each one of its 65,000 frames was hand-painted by 125 professional painters, including a re-imagining of over 120 of Van Gogh's own works.

This registration is needed to apply for posts as a consultant or a general practitioner (GP) respectively. As of 2010, there are postgraduate medical training programmes in 61 specialties that lead to the award of a CCT. This certificate is awarded by the General Medical Council (GMC), a self-funding statutory body independent of the government and the Royal Colleges of the various medical specialties. The GMC took on its role on 1 April 2010 following its merger with the former Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board. From 1995 to 2005, hospital doctors' training was assessed and deemed to be complete by the Specialist Training Authority (STA), which was formed by the combined Royal Colleges. The STA awarded a certificate called a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training, or CCST. Currently these two certificates are considered equivalent; however, the GMC has the authority to change the requirements for acquisition of a CCT so that in future they would not be regarded as equivalent. ==References * information on Certificates of Completion of Training (CCT) on the GMC website Category:Medical education in the United Kingdom Category:Professional titles and certifications Category:Year of introduction missing ","title":"Certificate of Completion of Training"},{"id":"6249871","text":"Jeremy Reich (born February 11, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player.

He currently serves in an assistant G.M and assistant coach with the Canmore Eagles of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). ==Playing career== After playing minor hockey with the Saskatoon Contacts of the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League (SMAAAHL), Reich began his major junior career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Seattle Thunderbirds in 1995‚Äì96. After his second WHL season, he was drafted 39th overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks. Upon being drafted, he remained in the WHL and during the 1997‚Äì98 season, he was traded from Seattle to the Swift Current Broncos in exchange for Jeffrey Beatch on December 20, 1997. Reich played his last WHL season with the Broncos in 1999‚Äì2000, turning pro the following season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Syracuse Crunch. He made his NHL debut in the 2003‚Äì04 season with the Columbus Blue Jackets, playing in 9 games and registering 1 assist during a call-up. Late in the 2004‚Äì05 AHL season, back with the Crunch, he was loaned to the Houston Aeros on March 10, 2005, in exchange for the loan of Jason Beckett. That off-season, he was signed as a free agent by the Boston Bruins on September 7, 2005. He subsequently began playing with Boston's AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, Reich scored his first NHL goal against his former team, the Columbus Blue Jackets, in a 2‚Äì0 win on December 15, 2007.

Carmel Coast railway station, sometimes spelled Haifa Hof HaKarmel) is an Israel Railways passenger station serving the city of Haifa, Israel. ==Location== The station is situated on the north-south Coastal line in southwest Haifa. It is located on Sakharov street adjacent to Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station, just north of Haifa South interchange, where the Coastal Highway (Highway 2) splits into Highway 4 and the Carmel Tunnels. The station is within walking distance of two shopping malls (Haifa Mall and Castra Mall), Haifa's Congressional Center and the MATAM hi-tech park. It is one of three railway stations serving the city of Haifa directly and one of six stations within Haifa's municipal borders. ==History== During the British Mandate, the station was known as Kfar Samir. Carmel Beach railway station was built during the first half of 1999 as part of the Carmel Beach Transport complex on the southern outskirts of Haifa. It opened on July 10, 1999. In the spring of 2006, work began on a second story to house a modern control and supervision center. The construction was completed by the end of 2007. During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict train service to the station was suspended after a Hezbollah Katyusha rocket hit a train depot in Haifa on July 16, 2006, killing 8 Israel Railways workers. This suspension meant that Haifa, in addition to the rest of northern Israel, was cut off from the train network. The service was reinstated several days later, after Israel Railways gave in to heavy public pressure led by Haifa's mayor, Yona Yahav. This made it the northernmost station to operate during the war, providing the only train link to the whole of northern Israel. ==Design== The station consists of two side platforms and one island platform, numbered from west to east (1 to 4), between each side platform and the island platform there are two rail tracks ‚Äì four in total. The length of western platform (platform 1) and the two platforms on the island platform (platforms 2 and 3) is 250 meters, while the eastern platform (platform 4) is only 70 meters in length. The main station hall is located to the east of the rail tracks. Several meters north of the entrance to the station there is a pedestrian tunnel connecting the railway station with the adjacent Carmel Beach Central Bus Station. In addition, a small station building is located to the west of the rail tracks, allowing access to the beach and the parking lot outside the station. The two side platforms and the island platform are interconnected by a pedestrian tunnel equipped with lifts allowing access for the disabled. A second tunnel connects the station's eastern and western sides, running alongside but separated by a glass brick wall from the platform-access tunnel, this tunnel was constructed after Haifa's city council demanded that a free access to the beach, west of the station, would be provided, bypassing any station territory where train tickets are required. Carmel Beach railway station is the only railway station in Israel with a reinforced concrete roof spanning from the eastern station hall to the western station building covering all the rail tracks and platforms, this roof eventually became the floor of the second story of the station, housing Israel Railways' computerized centralized traffic control center. Platform 1 is used for northbound Inter-City trains, platform 2 for southbound Inter-City trains. Platform 3 is used only for suburban trains requiring the relocation of the locomotive from one end of the train to the other and platform 4 is the primary platform used by suburban trains. ==Train service== Carmel Beach railway station is a station on the main North-South Coastal line of Israel Railways and serves intercity trains (Nahariya‚ÄìHaifa‚ÄìTel-Aviv‚ÄìBen-Gurion Airport Inter-City Service) operating on it and is a terminus for the suburban line serving Haifa's northern suburbs‚ÄìThe Qrayot, Akko, and Naharyia, as well as being an important interchange station between the two railway lines. It also serves trains operating on the Jezreel Valley railway. The station is situated between Haifa Bat Galim railway station to the north and Atlit railway station. ==Public transport connections== Carmel Beach railway station is adjacent to Carmel Beach Central Bus Station and connected to it via a pedestrian tunnel, this makes the station accessible from dozens of city and Inter-City bus lines. ==External links== *Israel Railways website Hof HaCarmel Category:Railway stations opened in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Israel ","title":"Haifa Hof HaCarmel railway station"},{"id":"6249877","text":"Oberhofen was a municipality in the district of Laufenburg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

He is the third member of the El√≠as family to compete in motorcycle racing. He currently rides a Suzuki GSX-R1000 in the MotoAmerica AMA Superbike Championship, where he finished 3rd in the 2016 season, with 6 wins out of 18 and 304 points, 7 less than champion Cameron Beaubier. He won the championship in the 2017 season. In 2018 he finished as runner-up behind champion Cameron Beaubier and in 2019 he finished as runner-up, 5 points behind championship winner, once again Beaubier. ==Career== Sepang in 2007. Born in Manresa, Catalonia, Spain El√≠as started racing in the 125cc World Championship in 2000 at the age of 17, finishing 3rd in 2001 and taking his first win in the Dutch TT at the prestigious Assen circuit. He went to 250cc for 2002, finishing 4th that year, 3rd a year later, and 4th in 2004. In 2005 he entered MotoGP for Fortuna Yamaha. In 2006 and 2007 his Fortuna backing has got him a ride for Gresini Honda alongside 2005 runner-up Marco Melandri. He only took one podium in 2006, albeit his first, and so far only, win in the top category. After a podium in the first half of 2007 he crashed at Assen, breaking his leg, sabotaging his season. He managed to make a return to the podium at Motegi. After spending the 2008 season with the Alice Ducati team, Elias returned to Gresini Honda for 2009, replacing Shinya Nakano to ride alongside Alex de Angelis. For 2010 he moved down to the new Moto2 class, on a Moriwaki bike for Gresini. He was competitive in pre-season testing before a heavy crash threatened to derail his status as title favourite. He was victorious at Le Mans after a chaotic race also led by Alex Deb√≥n and Jules Cluzel. He claimed the lead in the championship following this win, and would not relinquish it for the remainder of the season, clinching the inaugural Moto2 World Championship at the Malaysian Grand Prix with three rounds to spare. He returned to the MotoGP grid in 2011 with Team LCR, riding a Honda RC212V. 2011 heralded his worst season in the MotoGP class, scoring only 61 points and finishing 15th in the Championship. He left Team LCR, and will return to Moto2 in with the Aspar Racing Team, a team he rode for in the 250cc class. After Mugello race team and rider ended his relationship. On 24 July 2012, Pramac Ducati announced that Elias would replace the injured Hector Barbera until he was deemed fit to race. He raced a Satellite version of the GP12. At Laguna Seca he qualified 17th and retired during the race. He was scheduled to ride at Indianapolis but Barbera decided he wanted to return early, however Barbera suffered a high-side in Practice and injured his leg once more. Elias substituted for him until San Marino. ===First MotoGP Victory=== El√≠as won his first premier class race on 15 October 2006 with a fantastic final lap of the Portuguese MotoGP at Estoril. El√≠as had started the lap in third place, but an aggressive braking move into Curva 1, moved him past Valentino Rossi and the then-leader Kenny Roberts, Jr. into the lead. He actually clipped Roberts while braking, and this loss of momentum meant that Rossi passed Roberts for second position. These positions held until the chicane (turns 9 and 10) near the end of the lap. It looked like El√≠as had left the door wide open for Rossi and the reigning world champion dived to the inside to pass the Spaniard. However, El√≠as would keep pressuring Rossi, trying to pass him on the run towards turns 11 and 12. Rossi had the line and kept the position, and it seemed as if Rossi would be 13 points clear of title rival Nicky Hayden going to the final round in Valencia. But El√≠as kept the speed up through the thirteenth and final turn, and tucked in behind Rossi, to draft him alongside the Italian. In a finish that needed a video replay, El√≠as was given the race by just 0.002 seconds. It was one of the closest finishes in the history of MotoGP, and a great way for El√≠as to secure his maiden premier class victory. This victory helped secure him a contract extension, which was doubtful prior to the win at Estoril, with Honda and Fausto Gresini for the 2007 Moto GP season. El√≠as was the last non-factory rider to win a race until Jack Miller won for the Marc VDS Racing Team at the 2016 Dutch TT. As it turned out, El√≠as' victory cost Rossi five points, which was the exact number of points that Rossi would finish behind Hayden in the Championship standings. ==Career statistics== El√≠as on a Honda RC212V at the 2009 Dutch TT. ===Career summary=== {  style=\\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\\" !

Modern Oeschgen is first mentioned in 1234 as Escecon. In 1242 it was mentioned as Eschincon. The village was first owned by the Lords of Eschkon from the 13th to 15th centuries. They were vassals of Rheinfelden and occasionally the Habsburgs. From the mid-14th century until 1797, Oeschgen was part of the Austrian-Habsburg District of Laufenburg. In 1803 it was part of the Canton of Fricktal when it joined the new Canton of Aargau. The rights to low justice were held by the Lords of Gr√ºnenberg, then from 1475 until 1797 by the Lords of Sch√∂nau. In 1597-98 the Lords of Sch√∂nau built a manor house in the village. This manor later became the municipal administration building and was renovated between 1971-75. In the Second World War an internment camp for Polish soldiers was built near the village. The Lords of Sch√∂nau held the patronage right of the church of St. Cosmas and St. Damian. The church was probably from the late 12th century and a new building was built in 1912. Until the 19th century the major sources of income were viticulture and grain. By the start of the 21st century Oeschgen had become mostly residential, with some small businesses.

He studied violin as a child but later switched to guitar. His music contains elements of psychedelic rock, soul, folk, rock and roll, world music and blues, with deep literary influences. == Music career == After playing guitar in Joe Ely's touring band and appearing on one studio album, he spent time in Austin with his own groups, first Ian Moore and Moment's Notice, then The Ian Moore Band. While attending The University of Texas at Austin, Moore played in Austin regularly, quickly developing into one of Austin's largest draws. This led to his debut album which was released by Capricorn Records in 1993. The success of this album spawned multiple radio hits, TV appearances, and tours with artists such as Bob Dylan, ZZ Top, Paul Weller, and the Rolling Stones. His second record, Modernday Folklore, was voted one of the greatest art moments in Art of America, and led to more high level touring through the US and Europe, as well as his top charting song, Muddy Jesus, which made it into the top 5 AOR rock radio charts. Ian's musical journey has been vast and ambitious. His first two records pushed the envelope of the Blues Rock genre, including psychedelic, power pop, and heavy art influences, and predating bands such as My Morning Jacket and Gomez by many years. His mid period, coinciding with a move to the Pacific Northwest, found him exploring psychedelic folk on records such as his YepRoc records, Luminaria, which No Depression said belonged alongside Grant Lee Phillips and Wilco, channeling Scott Walker and the Beach Boys. Around 2006 Ian's records took a turn into the noise rock, power pop realm, as he released To Be Loved and El Sonido, now being compared to Matthew Sweet and Big Star. Pop Matters put it succinctly as they summed up his career to date, saying \\" Sure, he‚Äôs got his peers, but he‚Äôs ballsier than Josh Rouse, bluesier than Josh Ritter, grittier than Matthew Sweet, brainier than Ryan Adams, and more muscular than Grant-Lee Phillips. Moore‚Äôs transformation from trade bluesman to restless pop chameleon may be most closely echoed by Chris Whitley\\" which is short form of saying that Moore is not easily tagged by genre and comparison, and in his diversity and understanding of form, he is unique in his time. == Other career activities == Though mostly busy with his solo releases and touring, he has scored film and TV, as well as stints as a sidemen with artists as diverse as Jason Mraz and Roky Erickson. He has been on late night (Letterman) and morning television shows (Today). He has collaborated with Ice Cube, Prince B, Spiral Stairs, and more. In 2016 Moore toured the US five times, releasing a new soul covers EP, The Noble Art, starting a charity, SMASH, which assists Seattle musicians with health care, and becoming a Grammy Governor. In 2017, his latest release, Strange Days, was issued followed by more touring. ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Ian Moore (Capricorn 1993) *Live from Austin (Capricorn 1994) *Modernday Folklore (Capricorn 1995) *Ian Moore's Got the Green Grass (Habaldor 1998) *And All the Colors...

Peter I in 1704. A denga () was a Russian monetary unit with a value latterly equal to ¬Ω kopek (100 kopeks = 1 Russian ruble). Production of dengas as minted coins began in the middle of the 14th century. In their earliest form they were imitations of the silver coinage of the khans of the Golden Horde, usually bearing blundered or meaningless legends. Weighing about a gram, they were prepared by cutting silver wire into measured lengths, beating each length flat, and then striking the resulting blank between two dies. This resulted in slightly elongated coins, often showing traces of the original wire from which they had been taken. From Dmitry Donskoy's time onwards the coins began to take a more Russian form, with depictions of people, animals and Russian legends, although legends partly in Arabic (the official language of the Horde) persisted on some coins until the time of Ivan III. Dengas were made only in the southern Russian principalities; the state of Novgorod and the City of Pskov made their own slightly larger coins. In 1535 a reform took place, with the northern \\"novgorodka\\" being valued at twice the southern denga or \\"moskovka\\". In the 1540s novgorodkas depicting a horseman with a spear (Russian –∫–æ–ø—å—ë (kop'yo)) began to be made, and novgorodkas were thenceforth known as kopeks. The minting of silver dengas seems to have decreased after the 16th century, as they are found less often in hoards, but they are known until the reign of Peter the Great. By that time the coinage had devalued so far that dengas weighed only about 0.14 grams, and were of little practical use. In the coinage reform of 1700 they reappeared as much larger copper coins, and mintage continued, off and on, until 1916, just before the Romanov dynasty ended in 1917. Coins minted in the 18th century invariably showed the denomination as Denga, but during parts of the 19th century this was replaced by the word Denezhka, the diminutive form of Denga. Later still the denomination was shown simply as ¬Ω Kopek. The plural form of Denga, den'gi (–¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∏) has become the usual Russian word for 'money'. ==Post-reform silver denga mintage== * Ivan IV (1535-1584) * Feodor I (1584-1594) * Michael (1613-1645) * Alexis (1645-1655, 1663-1676) * Feodor III (1676-1682) * Ivan V (during joint rule with Peter the Great) (1683-1696) * Peter the Great (includes joint rule with Ivan V) (1683-1717) Silver dengas were not minted during the last years of Feodor I's rule, nor during the Time of Troubles, though silver wire kopecks were minted throughout this period, including emissions by imposters and invaders. ==Copper denga mintage== During the time of Peter the Great, dengas transitioned from silver to copper, and from undated to Byzantine dates in Cyrillic to Julian dates in Cyrillic. After Peter's reign, dates were denoted using the common notation of Arabic numerals. * Alexis (1654-1663, production ended in the aftermath of the Copper Riot) * Peter the Great (1700‚Äì1718) * Anna Ioannovna (1730‚Äì1731, 1734‚Äì1740) * Ivan VI of Russia (1741) * Elizabeth Petrovna (1743‚Äì1754, 1757‚Äì1760) * Peter III of Russia (1762) * Catherine II of Russia (1764, 1766‚Äì1775, 1783‚Äì1796) * Paul I of Russia (1797‚Äì1801) (19th Century mintage to follow) ==References Literature == *–£–∑–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –í. –ú–æ–Ω–µ—Ç—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ (1700‚Äî1917): –ò–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å–µ. ‚Äî –ú.: Collector‚Äôs Books; IP Media Inc., 2004. ==External links== * Kopek, denga, polushka: An English-language guide to Russian wire money * Examples of some 16th-century dengas at metaldetectingworld.com Category:Coins of Russia ","title":"Denga"},{"id":"6249981","text":"Zdenƒõk Kutl√°k (born February 13, 1980) is a Czech professional ice hockey defender who currently plays for Motor ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in 1st Czech Republic Hockey League. ==Playing career== Kutl√°k was drafted 237th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft from his local team HC ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice.

He became a land surveyor and surveyed large areas of western Canada, including photo-topographical surveys of the Selkirk Mountains and the British Columbia-Alberta boundary along the continental divide through the Canadian Rockies. In 1906, he and journalist Elizabeth Parker were the principal founders of the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC). He was its first president, from 1906 to 1910, and editor of the Canadian Alpine Journal from 1907 to 1930. He remained Honorary President of the ACC from 1926 until his death in 1945. The Arthur O. Wheeler hut of the ACC is named after him. == Early life == Wheeler was born on May 1, 1860 at The Rocks, the Wheeler family estate near Kilkenny, Ireland. He was educated at Ballinasloe College, County Galway, and at Dulwich College, London. The family fell upon hard times in Ireland, and in 1876 they sold their estates and moved to Canada, where his father took up the post of harbour master in Collingwood, Ontario. In 1876, at the age of 16, Wheeler met noted land surveyor, Lauchlan Alexander Hamilton, and became his apprentice. In 1877, Wheeler was hired by surveyor Elihu Stewart to work north of the Great Lakes in the Algoma District of Ontario, where he spent the summer paddling a birch bark canoe. In 1878 he again worked for Stewart and traveled from Winnipeg, Manitoba to Battleford, Saskatchewan using Red River ox carts to survey Indian reserves near Battleford and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In the following three years he returned to Ontario and studied to qualify as a Dominion Land Surveyor. He qualified as Ontario Land Surveyor in 1881; as Manitoba and Dominion Land Surveyor in 1882. == Career == In 1883, Wheeler was employed by the Canadian Government on pioneer surveys in the Northwest Territories, which then included the future provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta and parts of what are now Manitoba. In 1884 he sub-divided a number of Canadian Pacific Railway townsites along the line of railway construction. In 1885 he was appointed a technical officer of the Topographical Surveys Branch of the Department of the Interior in 1885 under Dr. Edouard Deville, Surveyor General of Canada, where he was trained in the specialty of photo-topographical surveying then being applied by Dr. Deville to the mapping of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. In 1885 the North-West Rebellion was begun by Louis Riel, which pitted the M√©tis people of the District of Saskatchewan against the government of Canada. Wheeler joined the Canadian militia as a lieutenant with the Dominion Land Surveyors Intelligence Corps under Captain J. S. Dennis and, with a group of other land surveyors, marched to help quell the rebellion. At the Battle of Batoche, one surveyor was killed and three others wounded. Wheeler was grazed in the shoulder by a sniper's bullet, but a few days later learned that his family in Ontario had been informed that he had been killed in action. After returning to Ottawa, Wheeler met Clara Macoun, daughter of famous Canadian botanist John Macoun who had made numerous trips to the northwest to survey the railway and evaluate the land for farming. Arthur married Clara in Ottawa in 1888. In 1891, Arthur, Clara, and their new son Edward Oliver Wheeler (known as Oliver) headed west to New Westminster, British Columbia where Wheeler went into private practice as a surveyor. His private surveying work was supplemented by work for the Department of the Interior, and he was joined in his surveying business by his younger brothers Hector and Willie. A real estate crash nearly wiped them out, and in 1894 he rejoined the Topographical Survey Branch of the Department of the Interior. Wheeler spent six years surveying the area south of Calgary, Alberta and in 1898 moved his wife and son to Calgary. During this period he surveyed the watersheds of the Elbow, Sheep, Highwood, Oldman, Belly, Waterton, Little Bow, St. Mary and Milk Rivers. In 1900, the Department of the Interior announced it was going to close its office in Calgary, so Wheeler spent the summer surveying the Crowsnest Pass area in Alberta, and in 1901 the Wheelers returned to Ottawa. In 1901, the Surveyor-General of Canada, Dr. Edouard Deville, assigned Wheeler the task of surveying the Rogers Pass area of the Selkirk Range in British Columbia. On the train to Rogers Pass, Wheeler met Edward Whymper, who had made the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and who was in Canada as a guest of the Canadian Pacific Railway. At Rogers Pass, Wheeler met a group of professional Swiss mountain guides in the employ of the railway, and it was with six of them that he made his first ascent of a major peak. He continued to climb mountains in the area, and in 1902 took his son Oliver on a first ascent of a previously unnamed peak, which he named Mount Oliver after his son. Wheeler also made a first ascent of a major peak, which he named Mount Wheeler after himself. In 1903, Wheeler was assigned the survey of the railway belt through the Canadian Rockies east of Rogers Pass. During the following two years, he met numerous American and British climbers who were making first ascents among the vast ranges of unclimbed peaks in the Canadian west. In 1904, Wheeler attended the International Geographic Congress, convened at Washington, as delegate from the Department of the Interior, and, while it was in session, visited Washington, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and the St. Louis World's Fair. In 1905 he was invited to speak at a meeting of the Appalachian Mountain Club in Boston. Later that year, he published a book called The Selkirk Range, the first book written by a Canadian to celebrate a mountain range. Wheeler returned to private practice from 1910 to 1913, and then was appointed Commissioner of the Alberta / British Columbia boundary survey. From 1913 to 1925 he was responsible for surveying the portion of the boundary which follows the Continental Divide of the Americas from the United States Boundary at the 49th parallel to its intersection with the 120th meridian, a distance of . During this assignment Wheeler named many of the peaks in the Kananaskis area of Alberta after World War I British and French generals, admirals and battleships. At its close, Wheeler retired from active professional work. == Alpine Club of Canada == After the American Alpine Club was founded in 1902, its first president Charles Fay whom Wheeler had met at Glacier House in Rogers Pass suggested that a Canadian chapter of the club be formed. Wheeler took up the task of promoting the idea, but Elizabeth Parker, a journalist at the Winnipeg Free Press, objected strenuously to Canada becoming a subsidiary to the United States in this matter. Wheeler took her objections to heart, and as a result, when the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC) was founded in 1906, Arthur Oliver Wheeler became its first President and Elizabeth Parker became its first Secretary. The Alpine Club of Canada was his most important contribution. He was involved in every phase of the club's activities for the last thirty-eight years of his life. He served as President of the ACC from 1906 to 1910, and then Managing Director for 16 years from 1907 to 1930. The year following the founding of the Club, he prepared the first issue of the Canadian Alpine Journal and was its editor for 20 years until 1927. In 1907, as President of the Alpine Club of Canada, he attended the 50th anniversary celebration dinner of the Alpine Club (UK) in London. In 1923 his beloved wife, Clara, died, and in 1924 he married Emmeline Savatard who had been the \\"Girl Friday\\" for the ACC for the previous 20 years and who remained with him until his death in 1945. On his retirement he was named Honorary President of the ACC, and held the position from 1926 until his death in early 1945. He continued to be active in the club and was the driving force behind two of its most successful expeditions: the Mount Robson camp which in 1913 made the first confirmed ascent of the highest mountain in the Canadian Rockies; and the 1925 first ascent of Mount Logan, the highest mountain in Canada. == Honors == Wheeler was elected an honorary member of the Dominion Land Surveyors Association, and served for many years as the Canadian representative on the International Commission on Glaciers. In 1908, proposed by the famous mountaineer Edward Whymper, Wheeler was elected to honorary membership in the Alpine Club (UK). He also became an honorary member of the French Alpine Club, the Appalachian Mountain Club and the American Alpine Club. In 1920, at the Allied Congress of Alpinism, the Prince of Monaco recognized Wheeler's good work by making him an Officer of the Order of St. Charles and conferring upon him the Cross of the Order. Wheeler was elected as one of the first Fellows of The Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 1930. Wheeler was Honorary President of the Alpine Club of Canada from 1926 to 1945 and the club's Arthur O. Wheeler hut near Rogers Pass was named after him. Although the ACC approved the project in 1938, construction did not begin until after the end of World War II in 1945. The hut built in his honor was not completed until 1947, two years after A.O. Wheeler died. It has been expanded and renovated many times since and remains one of the ACC's most popular huts. == Lineage == Wheeler was the great grandson of Jonas Wheeler, who was Lord Bishop of St. Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny, Ireland. His grandfather was William Oliver Wheeler, who fought with the 12th Royal Lancers against Napoleon in Portugal and Spain, and later became mayor of Kilkenny. Wheeler's father, Edward Oliver Wheeler, was a captain in the Kilkenny Fusiliers. He is the father of Sir Edward Oliver Wheeler, who participated in the first topographical survey of Mount Everest in 1921, and as Brigadier in the British Army was appointed Surveyor General of India in 1941. He is the grandfather of John Oliver Wheeler, an award- winning Canadian geologist.Winter 2002, Geolog Magazine- G.G. Awards J.O.

With Auerbach as the principal director, Love of Life was part of the early careers of actors Frances Sternhagen, Paul Michael Glaser, Christopher Reeve, Roy Scheider, Bonnie Bedelia, Jessica Walter, Nancy Marchand, Ray Wise, Jonathan Frakes,Twitter https://twitter.com/jonathansfrakes/status/546442605459165184 Warren BeattyFinstad, Suzanne (2005). Warren Beatty: A Private Man. New York: Three Rivers. p. 564. and Peter Falk. Love of Life ran for 28 years, with Auerbach at the helm for most of the episodes and still directing when the show ended in 1980 (at the time, it was the second-longest running show on television).Greenfield, Jeff. CBS Evening News broadcast, February 1, 1980. The series concluded with Auerbach walking from empty set to empty set, turning off the lights, accompanied by Tony Bennett's song, \\"We'll Be Together Again\\". From there, Auerbach went on to direct several other New York-based soap operas, including All My Children, One Life to Live, Another World and As the World Turns. By the time of his retirement from directing in the 1990s, Auerbach had reached iconic status in New York daytime drama circles, with a career that spanned five decades. He was among those interviewed by Dustin Hoffman for the comedy set on a soap opera studio, Tootsie. Given the never- ending production cycle of soap operas (without rerun seasons) and the massive number of minutes produced each week (many soap operas are now daily one-hour shows, as opposed to the early 15-, 30-, or 45-minute episodes), It seems likely that Auerbach has directed more dramatic (i.e., non-news) television than any other American director (approximately 3,000 hours). ==Awards and recognition== Auerbach received the Directors Guild of America's Robert B. Aldrich Award in 1991, and was named a Honorary Life Member of the Directors Guild in 2004, joining a small, elite group that includes Charles Chaplin, David Lean, Frank Capra, Walt Disney, Darryl F. Zanuck, Louis B. Mayer, Jack L. Warner, Lew Wasserman, Elia Kazan, Chuck Jones, Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Jack Valenti. He also received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in 1984 for his work on ABC's One Life to Live. His recollections and advice on directing soaps are featured in the books The Box: An Oral History of Television 1920‚Äì1961 by Jeff Kisseloff, Take One: Television Directors on Directing by Jack Kuney and Directing for Television: Conversations with American TV Directors by Brian G. Rose. His work on All My Children is featured in an episode of the 1982 PBS series Media Probes. A collection of kinescopes of his early work on Love of Life is archived at The Paley Center for Media in New York. ==Death== Complications from brain cancer led to Auerbach's death in La Jolla, California, at age 91.Obituaries in the Performing Arts ==ReferencesInterview with Larry Auerbach about directing * Magazine profile on Larry Auerbach and soap operas * Larry Auerbach obituary * Directors Guild obituary statement Category:American television directors Category:Daytime Emmy Award winners Category:1923 births Category:2014 deaths ","title":"Larry Auerbach"},{"id":"6250052","text":"Red Pike is a fell in the English Lake District. It is 826 m or high and lies due north of Wast Water. It is often climbed as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a walk which also includes Pillar. The fell can be confused with Red Pike (Buttermere), not least because its namesake is only three miles away, so according to Alfred Wainwright it is conventional to call it Wasdale Red Pike. ==Topography== The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Red Pike is an outlier of the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. Travelling in this direction the principal hills are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. Scoat Fell throws out a long southern ridge terminating in Yewbarrow and Red Pike stands part way along. The Red Pike ridge occupies a broad area of high country between Nether Beck in the west and Mosedale in the east. The Mosedale face is steeper with considerable areas of Crag, whilst the western slopes descend slowly over a couple of miles. The ridge begins at an unnamed col to the southeast of Scoat Fell. This narrow depression is squeezed between Black Comb, the birthplace of Mosedale Beck, and Scoat Tarn, the primary feeder of Nether Beck. From the depression it is only a short climb to the summit of Red Pike, the majority of the ridge lying beyond on the long south easterly descent to Dore Head. At this col the watershed turns south west, rising to the twin summits of Yewbarrow. Dore Head is the source of Over Beck, the stream separating Yewbarrow from the long western flanks of Red Pike. Red Pike presents an almost continuous wall of crags above Mosedale, particularly above Black Comb. Bull and Black Crags meanwhile guard the southern section. To the west a long shoulder of land falls gradually between Nether Beck and Over Beck, narrowing as they converge toward the shore of Wastwater. In the middle of the plateau is Low Tarn, a large shallow waterbody lying in a flat basin. It drains via Brimfull Beck into Over Beck. This whole area is unfrequented with few paths amongst the grassy hillocks and low crags. Scoat Tarn at the head of Nether Beck is by contrast a corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines. Its depth is around .Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Red Pike has a subsidiary southern top with a height of . ==Geology== The fell is mainly composed of the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation. There are also sills of lapilli-tuff and intrusions of rhyolite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheets 29 and 38: BGS (1999) and (1998) ==Summit== The main summit bears a cairn perched on the brink of the Mosedale Crags. To the west is a gentle slope, carpeted with short turf. The southern top also bears a large cairn and, a hundred yards beyond, is The Chair. This is an armchair shaped windshelter built onto a rock outcrop, a few yards off the path. It provides a fine vantage point for views southward, and is so prominent on the climb from Dore Head that it once gave its name to the fell. Scoat Fell and Pillar obstruct the view northward. The Scafells are well seen, as are the Wasdale Screes. ==Ascents== From Overbeck Bridge on the Wastwater road a way can be found up to Low Tarn, gaining the summit via the long western slopes. Alternatively Over Beck can be followed to its source at Dore Head, before making up the south ridge. Dore Head can also be reached from Mosedale if starting from Wasdale Head, although a long climb up scree is involved. It is possible instead to ascend Black Comb on easier slopes and then return to the summit. Red Pike is often the start of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a ridgewalk also visiting Scoat Fell and Pillar. Depending upon the strength of the walker Yewbarrow and Kirk Fell may also be added.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==References * Striding Edge Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Hewitts of England Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"Red Pike (Wasdale)"},{"id":"6250055","text":"Yo Yo, original title Yoyo, is a 1965 French comedy film by Pierre √âtaix. The story follows the son of a millionaire from the 1920s to the 1960s. After losing his fortune in the stock-exchange crash, he teams up with an equestrienne and becomes a circus clown. The film was entered into the 1965 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Yo Yo is the son of a 1920s billionaire who, although having everything he fancies and living in a cavernous old castle, is not happy, fancying the simple life of a beautiful circus actress. When the stock-exchange crashes, rendering him both poor and free, he joins the circus where his love interest is performing, and falls madly in love.

It competed at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, where it received the OCIC Award. It was released in the United States on 28 February 1967 through Magna Pictures Distribution. ==Reception== The film received some harsh reviews in France, which affected √âtaix's next film, As Long as You've Got Your Health. Jean-Luc Godard included Yo Yo on his top-ten list of the best films of 1965. The American comedian Jerry Lewis saw the film during a visit to France and enjoyed it so much that he asked to meet its creator. A French television team that had been appointed to interview Lewis captured the meeting, where the two comedians, limited by the language barrier, made impressions of each other's comedy routines and improvised clown acts together. Lewis later cast √âtaix in his own unreleased film The Day the Clown Cried. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times reviewed the film upon the American release: > Mr. Etaix is marvelously talented. He is a master of subtle mimicry, and he > plays all sorts of charming little incidents with great sensitivity and wit. > ... But that's the trouble with his picture. It's too casual, fragmented and > loose. It's as though Mr. Etaix were writing his script as he goes along, > tossing in scenes he remembers from somebody else's film, letting himself do > something (he also plays several minor roles without taking credit for them) > more to display his virtuosity than to develop a story and character. In 2007, Time Out London described the film as \\"possibly the best of Etaix's features\\", and wrote that \\"Etaix has just enough astringency to keep sentimentality at bay, and his mastery of the sight gag amply justifies Jerry Lewis' enthusiasm for the film, which is singularly beautifully shot by Jean Boffety.\\" ==References External links == * * Category:French films Category:1965 films Category:1965 comedy films Category:Circus films Category:French-language films Category:French black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Pierre √âtaix Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri√®re Category:World War II films ","title":"Yo Yo"},{"id":"6250063","text":"An interim championship is an alternate title that is awarded by the four major sanctioning bodies of professional boxing (WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO), and in other combat sports such as kickboxing, professional wrestling, and mixed martial arts. Occasionally, the champion of a particular weight division is temporarily unable to defend his championship because of medical, legal, or other reasons that are beyond the competitor's control. When this case occurs, two highly ranked contenders may fight for an interim championship of the same weight division ‚Äì leading to two champions existing in the same weight division simultaneously. Once the original champion is able to return, at the discretion of the sanctioning body concerned, they must defend their title against the interim champion - who will relinquish their interim title in order to fight for the full world title. If the original champion cannot return, refuses to defend their title or transfers to a different weight division, the interim champion is then promoted to full championship status.

The stadium opened in 1959 as Manatee Junior College Field. In 1977 it was renamed after Robert C. Wynn, the State College of Florida coach who started the baseball program at the College in 1959. In 2012 the field received national recognition as the only college or university this year to be awarded the prestigious American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) TURFACE Field Maintenance Award. In 2007 the stadium was also briefly the home of the Bradenton Juice, of the South Coast League. However the field could not a provide the proper environment for minor league baseball. Two examples cited by league officials were the team's inability to sell beer and have post-game fireworks, due to the stadium being located on the college's campus. As a result, the attendance for the Juice games was dismal with only 148 fans attending a May 25, 2007 game at the stadium against the Macon Music. The Juice folded after the 2007 season and the league became dormant in 2008. The baseball facilities were renovated during the 2010‚Äì2011 school year.

The standpoint of the Hungarian Anti-Doping Committee was that the athlete is innocent and the charge does not hold and together with the Hungarian Olympic Committee and the Hungarian Athletics Association they dispensed the athlete after their investigation. The IAAF did not accept this, thus the Hungarian Athletics Association appealed to the CAS (International Sport Court) and fully supported the athlete arguing all the evidence contradicts the controller's word.

He completed 46 of his 49 starts that year, hurled six shutouts, and logged 469 innings pitched. He collected 216 wins in his first eight professional seasons. Weyhing was nicknamed \\"Cannonball\\", \\"Rubber Arm\\", and \\"Rubber-Winged Gus\\". Weyhing was known to be a poor hitter and suspect fielder. He holds the dubious honor of having hit the most batters in a career (277). ==Baseball career== Weyhing was a solid pitcher, though he never led the league in any specific categories. He did have a few career highlights, however. In one memorable week in the 1888 season, Weyhing pitched three consecutive complete game victories against Brooklyn to eliminate that team from the pennant race. In addition, Weyhing came close to throwing a perfect game when he hurled a no-hitter on July 31, 1888, against the Kansas City Cowboys. He walked one batter and another reached base via an error. He set the record for most hit baseman with 278. ==Accusations of theft== One odd report, taken from the local Louisville, Kentucky newspaper, tells the tale of Weyhing's possible involvement in a pigeon theft. The following report is from newspaper accounts in Louisville (Weyhing's hometown) in 1892: It appears that Weyhing was either cleared of the charges, or found guilty and took care of the matter before the 1892 season commenced.

In their mythology, Imana was the creator and the supporter of all the Barundi and Banyarwanda people. Imana was seen as almighty and gracious, intervening in one of the legends in an altercation between a man who had always borrowed beans from different people but wriggled out of repaying the debt. Imana ruled all living things and gave them immortality by hunting an animal known as Death. Death was a savage wild animal who represented the state of death. While Imana was hunting, everybody was told to stay hidden so that Death would have nobody to kill or take refuge to. But one day while he was hunting, an old woman crept out into her vegetable garden to get vegetables. Death quickly hid under her skirt and was taken inside the house with her. She died because of Death. Three days after the funeral of the old woman, the old woman's daughter-in- law, who hated her, saw cracks where she was buried as if she would arise and live again. She filled the cracks with dirt and pounded the earth with a heavy pestle and cried \\"Stay dead!\\" Two days later she did the same thing when she saw more cracks by the grave. Three days later there were no cracks left for her to pound dirt into. This signified the end of man's chances of coming back to life. Death had become endemic or constantly present.

It was purchased by Zuffa, LLC, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), in 2006. In its final incarnation, it was made up of 3 weight classes: , and . To accommodate the smaller fighters, WEC's cage was in diameter‚Äî smaller than the standard UFC cage. The smaller cage is now used by UFC for selected events. ==History== Scott Adams and Reed Harris started the organization in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, most of their events were held at Tachi Palace Hotel & Casino in Lemoore, California, and aired on HDNet. In December 2006, Zuffa purchased WEC. With the purchase, WEC continued as a separate promotion with its own roster of fighters. Adams was retained after the purchase as the organization's matchmaker. Harris and Adams were named co-General Managers and were both active in the new WEC. In 2008, Sean Shelby was named the new match- maker for the promotion by Zuffa. Zuffa made several changes to the promotion after the purchase. It discontinued its pentagonal cage for a modified version of the UFC's octagonal cage, with a 25-foot diameter instead of the UFC's 30-foot diameter cage. The championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters were vacated. The promotion moved to focus on lighter weight classes, abandoning their heavyweight and super heavyweight divisions and championships, and retaining their bantamweight and featherweight divisions‚Äîtwo divisions not then present in the UFC. After the purchase, several WEC events were held in Zuffa's hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada, much like the UFC. WEC aired their events live on Versus (formerly known as the Outdoor Life Network and now as the NBC Sports Network) in the United States and on TSN (and later The Score) in Canada. WEC's first live event was broadcast on June 3, 2007, on Versus from The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Todd Harris was the play by play announcer on every televised WEC event on Versus, and was joined by former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir on color commentary until the spring of 2010, when Mir was replaced by UFC light heavyweight Stephan Bonnar. Fellow Zuffa fighters Kenny Florian and Jens Pulver have also filled in on color commentary due to Mir or Bonnar's absences. UFC announcers Mike Goldberg and Joe Rogan called WEC's only pay-per-view event, WEC 48 in April 2010. Postfight interviews on the Versus-televised cards were typically done by either Harris or Versus sportscaster Craig Hummer. Joe Martinez served as the announcer for Zuffa- promoted WEC events until April 2010, when he left the organization and was replaced by UFC announcer Bruce Buffer. However, Martinez made a one-off return at WEC 52 that November when Buffer was overseas for a UFC event. WEC announced that it would dissolve their light heavyweight and middleweight divisions after their December 3, 2008 event to further their concentration on lighter classes. Fighters from the light heavyweight and middleweight divisions started fighting in the UFC after the dissolution of their divisions. Also, on February 3, 2009, WEC officially announced the creation of a flyweight division and the dissolution of its welterweight division (flyweight would have been the last division under the \\"Unified Rules of MMA\\" to be activated under Zuffa, excluding Super Heavyweight). Fighters from the welterweight division started fighting in the UFC after the dissolution of their division. The only weight class that still crossed over between WEC and the UFC prior to the merger was the lightweight division. On January 8, 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting announced that Amp Energy would be the official energy drink of WEC. Amp Energy also sponsored three of WEC's top stars - featherweight Urijah Faber, featherweight Chad Mendes, and bantamweight Joseph Benavidez. On April 24, 2010, WEC held its only pay-per-view event, WEC 48, which featured two championship fights. The main event featured WEC Featherweight Champion Jos√© Aldo defending his title against former champion Urijah Faber. On October 28, 2010, UFC President Dana White announced that WEC would merge with the UFC.http://mmajunkie.com/news/21189/ufc-and-wec-set-to- merge-in-2011-events-to-air-on-versus-and-spike-tv.mma ==Relationship with the UFC== Due to its shared ownership under Zuffa, fans and commentators had continually speculated about a unification between WEC and the UFC, particularly the lower weight classes. The relationship between the WEC and UFC had also been complicated by their respective primary partnerships with cable television channels, Versus and Spike, Fight Magazine reported. On October 28, 2010, Dana White announced the merger with the UFC. ==Media coverage== On December 11, 2006, UFC parent-company, Zuffa, formalized plans to buy World Extreme Cagefighting, to be run as a separate promotion from the UFC. Following the purchase of WEC, Zuffa made several changes to the promotion. One of the most noteworthy changes included added media exposure when WEC signed a deal to air events on Versus beginning with WEC 28. Prior to this WEC had broadcast most of their events on HDNet. While on Versus, most events aired mid-week, or on Sunday nights during the summer months. WEC drew good ratings that averaged around 575,000 average viewers per event. However ratings ranged from 245,000 to 1,500,000. The biggest ratings draw for WEC was Urijah Faber. When Faber was featured in the main event he drew an average of 840,000 viewers. Faber was also featured in both main events (34 and 41) that drew over a million viewers for WEC.

They are not dangerous to human health but are used to indicate the presence of a health risk. Each gram of human feces contains approximately ~100 billion () bacteria. These bacteria may include species of pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella or Campylobacter, associated with gastroenteritis. In addition, feces may contain pathogenic viruses, protozoa and parasites. Fecal material can enter the environment from many sources including waste water treatment plants, livestock or poultry manure, sanitary landfills, septic systems, sewage sludge, pets and wildlife. If sufficient quantities are ingested, fecal pathogens can cause disease. The variety and often low concentrations of pathogens in environmental waters makes them difficult to test for individually. Public agencies therefore use the presence of other more abundant and more easily detected fecal bacteria as indicators of the presence of fecal contamination. == Criteria for indicator organisms== The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists the following criteria for an organism to be an ideal indicator of fecal contamination: # The organism should be present whenever enteric pathogens are present # The organism should be useful for all types of water # The organism should have a longer survival time than the hardiest enteric pathogen # The organism should not grow in water # The organism should be found in warm-blooded animals‚Äô intestines. None of the types of indicator organisms that are currently in use fit all of these criteria perfectly, however, when cost is considered, use of indicators becomes necessary. == Types of indicator organisms == Commonly used indicator bacteria include total coliforms, or a subset of this group, fecal coliforms, which are found in the intestinal tracts of warm blooded animals. Total coliforms were used as fecal indicators by public agencies in the US as early as the 1920s. These organisms can be identified based on the fact that they all metabolize the sugar lactose, producing both acid and gas as byproducts. Fecal coliforms are more useful as indicators in recreational waters than total coliforms which include species that are naturally found in plants and soil; however, there are even some species of fecal coliforms that do not have a fecal origin, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Perhaps the biggest drawback to using coliforms as indicators is that they can grow in water under certain conditions. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci are also used as indicators. ==Current methods of detectionMembrane filtration and culture on selective media=== Enterococci colonies growing on a selective agar after membrane filtration. Indicator bacteria can be cultured on media which are specifically formulated to allow the growth of the species of interest and inhibit growth of other organisms. Typically, environmental water samples are filtered through membranes with small pore sizes and then the membrane is placed onto a selective agar. It is often necessary to vary the volume of water sample filtered in order to prevent too few or too many colonies from forming on a plate. Bacterial colonies can be counted after 24 to 48 hours depending on the type of bacteria. Counts are reported as colony forming units per 100 mL (cfu/100 mL). ===Fast detections using chromogenic substances=== One technique for detecting indicator organisms is the use of chromogenic compounds, which are added to conventional or newly devised media used for isolation of the indicator bacteria. These chromogenic compounds are modified to change color or fluorescence by the addition of either enzymes or specific bacterial metabolites. This enables for easy detection and avoids the need for isolation of pure cultures and confirmatory tests.Ashbolt, N., Snozzi, G. and M. (2001). Water Quality: Guidelines, Standards and Health. World Health Organization (WHO). Chapter 13: Indicators of Microbial Water Quality. p. 289-316 ===Application of antibodies=== Immunological methods using monoclonal antibodies can be used to detect indicator bacteria in water samples. Precultivation in select medium must preface detection to avoid detection of dead cells. ELISA antibody technology has been developed to allow for readable detection by the naked eye for rapid identification of coliform microcolonies. Other uses of antibodies in detection use magnetic beads coated with antibodies for the concentration and separation of the oocysts and cysts as described below for immunomagnetic separation (IMS) methods. ===IMS/culture and other rapid culture-based methods=== Immunomagnetic separation involves purified antigens biotinylated and bound to streptoavidin-coated paramagnetic particles. The raw sample is mixed with the beads, then a specific magnet is used to hold the target organisms against the vial wall and the non-bound material is poured off. This method can be used to recover specific indicator bacteria. ===Gene sequence-based methods=== Gene sequence-based methods depend on the recognition of exclusive gene sequences particular to specific strains of organisms. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are gene sequence-based methods currently being used to detect specific strains of indicator bacteria. == Water quality standards for bacteria  Drinking water standards === World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality state that as an indicator organism Escherichia coli provides conclusive evidence of recent fecal pollution and should not be present in water meant for human consumption. In the U.S., the EPA Total Coliform Rule states that a water system is out of compliance if more than 5 percent of its monthly water samples contain coliforms. . === Recreational standards === Early studies showed that individuals who swam in waters with geometric mean coliform densities above 2300/100 mL for three days had higher illness rates. In the 1960s, these numbers were converted to fecal coliform concentrations assuming 18 percent of total coliforms were fecal. Consequently, the National Technical Advisory Committee in the US recommended the following standard for recreational waters in 1968: 10 percent of total samples during any 30-day period should not exceed 400 fecal coliforms/100 mL or a log mean of 200/100 mL (based on a minimum of 5 samples taken over not more than a 30-day period). Document no. EPA-440/5-84-002. Despite criticism, EPA recommended this criterion again in 1976, however, the Agency initiated numerous studies in the 1970s and 1980s to overcome the weaknesses of the earlier studies. In 1986, EPA revised its bacteriological ambient water quality criteria recommendations to include E. coli and enterococci. {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" !! colspan=\\"4\\" Single Sample Maximum Allowable Density per 100 mL - !

This approach generally results in lower levels if E. coli being used as a standard or ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù based on a study that indicated pathogens were detected in 80% of water samples with less than 100 cfu E. coli per 100 mL. == Risk assessment for exposure to pathogens in recreational waters == Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are caused by food-borne enteric microorganisms, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter; however, it is also important to understand the risk of exposure to pathogens via recreational waters. This is especially the case in watersheds where human or animal wastes are discharged to streams and downstream waters are used for swimming or other recreational activities. Other important pathogens other than bacteria include viruses such as rotavirus, hepatitis A and hepatitis E and protozoa like giardia, cryptosporidium and Naegleria fowleri. Due to the difficulties associated with monitoring pathogens in the environment, risk assessments often rely on the use of indicator bacteria. New River as it enters California is dark green, white (foam), and milky brown/green. Fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci have been consistently detected in the New River at the Mexico-US border. === Epidemiological studies === In the 1950s, a series of epidemiological studies were done in the US to determine the relationship between water quality of natural waters and the health of bathers. The results indicated that swimmers were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms, eye infections, skin complaints, ear, nose, and throat infections and respiratory illness than non-swimmers and in some cases, higher coliform levels correlated to higher incidence of gastrointestinal illness, although the sample sizes in these studies were small. Since then, studies have been done to confirm causative relations between swimming and certain health outcomes. A review of 22 studies in 1998 confirmed that the health risks for swimmers increased as the number of indicator bacteria increased in recreational waters and that E. coli and enterococci concentrations correlated best with health outcomes among all the indicators studied. The relative risk (RR) of illness for swimmers in polluted freshwater versus swimmers in unpolluted water was between 1-2 for the majority of the data sets reviewed. The same study concluded that bacterial indicators were not well correlated to virus concentrations. === Fate and transport of pathogens === Survival of pathogens in waste materials, soil, or water, depends on many environmental factors including temperature, pH, organic matter content, moisture, exposure to light, and the presence of other organisms. Fecal material can be directly deposited, washed into waters by overland runoff, transported through the ground, or discharged to surface waters via sewer lines, pipes, or drainage tiles. Risk of exposure to humans requires: (1) pathogens to survive and be present; (2) pathogens to recreate in surface waters; and (3) individuals to come in contact with water for sufficient time, or ingest sufficient volumes of water to receive an infectious dose. Die-off rates of bacteria in the environment are often exponential, therefore, direct deposition of fecal material into waters generally contribute higher concentrations of pathogens than material that must be transported overland or through the subsurface. === Human exposure === In general, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals require a lower dose of a pathogenic organism in order to contract an infection. Presently there are very few studies which are able to quantify the amount of time people are likely to spend in recreational waters and how much water they are likely to ingest. In general, children swim more often, stay in the water longer, submerge their heads more often, and swallow more water. This makes people more fearful of water in the sea as more bacteria will be growing on and around them. === Quantitative microbiological risk assessment === Quantitative microbiological risk assessments (QMRAs) combine pathogen concentrations in water with dose-response relationships and data reflecting potential exposure to estimate the risk of infection. Data on water exposure are generally collected using questionnaires, but may also be determined from actual measurements of water ingested, or estimated from previously published data. Respondents are asked to report the frequency and timing and location of exposures, detailed information about the amount of water swallowed and head submersion, and basic demographic characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status and family composition. Once sufficient data are collected and determined to be representative of the general population, they are usually fit with distributions, and these distribution parameters are then used in the risk assessment equations. Monitoring data representing occurrence of pathogens, direct measurement of pathogen concentrations, or estimations deriving pathogen concentrations from indicator bacteria concentrations, are also fit with distributions. Dose is calculated by multiplying the concentration of pathogens per volume by volume. Dose-responses can also be fit with a distribution. === Risk management and policy implications === The more assumptions that are made, the more uncertain estimates of risk related to pathogens will be. However, even with considerable uncertainty, QMRAs are a good way to compare different risk scenarios. In a study comparing estimated health risks from exposures to recreational waters impacted by human and non- human sources of fecal contamination, QMRA determined that the risk of gastrointestinal illness from exposure to waters impacted by cattle were similar to those impacted by human waste, and these were higher than for waters impacted by gull, chicken, or pig faeces. Such studies could be useful to risk managers for determining how best to focus their limited resources, however, risk managers must be aware of the limitations of data used in these calculations. For example, this study used data describing concentrations of Salmonella in chicken feces published in 1969. Methods for quantifying bacteria, changes in animal housing practices and sanitation, and many other factors may have changed the prevalence of Salmonella since that time. Also, such an approach often ignores the complicated fate and transport processes that determine bacteria concentrations from the source to the point of exposure. == Addressing bacterial water quality problems == In the US, individual states are allowed to develop their own water quality standards based on EPA's recommendations under the Clean Water Act of 1977. Once water quality standards are approved, states are tasked with monitoring their surface waters to determine where impairments occur, and watershed plans called Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) are developed to direct water quality improvement efforts including changes to allowable bacteria loading by point sources and recommendations for changes to practices that reduce nonpoint- source contributions to bacteria loads.

Born in Fuch≈´, Tokyo as the son of a doctor, he began studying Marxist philosophy at the age of twenty, in 1947, following the defeat of Japan and the subsequent U.S. occupation of Japan. At this time the workers movement in Japan was quite strong, but very influenced by pro-Soviet politics. Kuroda began studying closely works by prominent Japanese philosophers, among them Umemoto Katsumi, Kakehashi Akihide and Uno K≈çz≈ç. In 1956, following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Kuroda joined Kurihara T≈çichi in forming the first Trotskyist organization in Japanese history. Kuroda criticised the mechanical \\"materialism\\" that was prevalent in the orthodox Marxism, and instead developed a philosophical theory of \\"Materialist Subjectivity\\". In 1959, Kuroda became the Chairman of the Japan Revolutionary Communist League. He wrote over fifty books published both in Japan and other countries on such subjects as Marxist philosophy, the analysis of Soviet society, Japanese cultural history, theory and praxis of organization building, and contemporary politics. From 1963, Kuroda was the central theoretical figure in the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction), remaining active in the group until retiring late in life.Hayashi Hiroyoshi, Marx's Labor Theory of Value == Works == * Hegel and Marx , May 1952 * Destruction of the Revolution, 1991 * Gorbachev's Nightmare, 1992 * Praxiology, 1998 * Kuroda's Thought on Revolution, 2000 * Engels' Political Economy, 2000 * Dialectics of Praxis, 2001 * On Organizing Praxis, 2001 * Studies on Marxism in Postwar Japan, 2002 * Dialectics of Society, 2003 * Methodology of Social Science, 2005 == Notes == * Praxiology (Ëã±Ë™ûÁâàÊîπË®Ç) is defined as the philosophy of Inter-Human Subjectivity == References == Category:1927 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Fuch≈´, Tokyo Category:20th-century Japanese philosophers Category:Japanese communists Category:Japanese Marxists Category:Marxist theorists Category:Trotskyists ","title":"Kuroda Kan'ichi"},{"id":"6250181","text":"The Bolmen Water Tunnel () is a water supply tunnel, long.

The series was re-aired internationally in 2012 via The Brand New Cinema One Global (Movie Entertainment Channel) after 8 years. ==Plot== Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto (Lorna Tolentino) are twins. Lorrea accidentally takes the place of her twin sister in the world of the drug lords. After many trials and tribulations she finds her missing son, Andrei/Yuri (John Lloyd Cruz). ==Plot and synopsis== The Story revolves on twins Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto (both portrayed by Lorna Tolentino). Lorrea grows up feeling abandoned by her mother (Perla Bautista) who loves Lorrinda more. Lorrea does all that she can to save her family from a series of events that threaten to tear the family apart. This includes her rape at the hands of Francis Ventaspejo (Ricky Davao) who lives in the same village and hometown. Lorrea has a child and names him Andrei but loses him. She tries to get him back but is, in the process, blamed for murdering Francis' father. A remorseful Francis enters the seminary and becomes a priest As she is thrown in jail by the powerful family Lorrea comes face to face with Lorrinda who offers to help her escape. To do so, Lorrea must enter the world of the drug lords and as a step mother and wife to Henri Argos (Edu Manzano) a powerful and influential character, and meets Brigitta (Bing Loyzaga), an associate of Henri who secretly has feelings for him. Lorrea turns into Lorrinda, known to the people of the underworld as \\"Red Butterfly\\" or \\"Red\\". She is also plunged into meeting a long lost love Boris Archangel (John Estrada) the man that Lorrea and Lorrinda once loved, who works for Henri as his right-hand man. Despite all unnecessary events there is also her son Andrei who now grows up as Yuri Orbida (John Lloyd Cruz) the son adopted by Mirdo Orbida (Ronnie Lazaro) whom he grows to love as a real father. Yuri becomes accepted at a new school in Manila and meets Helaena Argos (Rica Peralejo) at the university; the two meet and form a bond. Helaena falls for Yuri, to the dismay of Kayla (Dimples Romana) Yuri's childhood friend and even crush. Meanwhile, Yuri and his childhood friend Ivan (Jhong Hilario) reunite. Ivan's adoptive mother dies in suicide and Ivan retaliates by revealing to Lorrea that her son Andrei died. Henri Argo's criminal empire is ruined, Yuri vows revenge upon \\"Red\\" for killing his adoptive father, Kayla is attacked, and the truth is finally revealed about Henri being the drug lord, syndicate, leaving the family penniless. Helaena is heartbroken after overhearing Yuri's true feelings for her and his true love for Kayla. Helaena, a longtime love of Anilov Mijares (Bernard Palanca), eventually tries to support her family and becomes a prostitute. Lady Morganna (Jean Garcia), Brigitta's evil sister and now Boris' wife, enters the picture and plans to make \\"Red's\\" family all suffer. Helaena is connected to Anilov and has sessions with him as Mister X, an Alter Ego. Unknown to Yuri is that Dimitri (Johnny Delgado), who was once his professor and taught him law, is the one who is also connected to his plans for revenge. He grows to hate Anilov, for not stopping his older sister who eventually dies overdosing on a drug made by Henri's family. After 8 years, Lorrea is still alive and Lady Morganna's old enemies resurface. Yuri falls for Katrina (Bea Alonzo) Henri's younger daughter who has just finished becoming a lawyer the two eventually fall in love. Kayla is successful as well but suffers from jealousy. Dimitri adopts Yuri and takes him under his wing. On the other hand, Lady Morganna becomes insane and eventually tries to shoot Lorrea, but shoots Boris instead. Yuri is unwilling to forgive Lorrea because there is not enough proof to make him believe she is the real Lorrea and not Lorrinda. Lorrea's face is fixed after surgery after the bomb explosion that is planted by Lady Morganna. The real Lorrinda/\\"Red Butterfly\\" is alive having suffered from a head trauma and amnesia after the bombing in the Jail. Lorrinda then defends her twin and says that the series of events that took place will truly reveal that everything was staged and that everything was her fault. Yuri then accepts the truth. Helaena and Anilov marry and have a child while Lorrea takes care of Alyssa, both Lady Morganna and Boris' child. Lady Morganna takes full responsibility for all the attempts and killings, and later on commits suicide in jail due to the guilt for Borris' death. Yuri becomes a law lecturer in a university and accepts Lorrea and Francis as his parents and all is forgiven. ==Cast== * Lorna Tolentino portrays two roles: **Lorrea Guinto / Lea Mijares - (the female protagonist) is the good twin trying to find her lost son Andre. **Lorrinda Guinto / Ingrid Medrano / Red Butterfly - (the female antagonist) has always wanted more than life had to offer for her so she became a part of the drug syndicate and adopted the names Ingrid Medrano and Red Butterfly.

It is located nine kilometres (5¬Ω miles) west of the town of Keswick and is well seen from the B5292 road which crosses the Whinlatter Pass. ==Topography== Hopegill Head is the middle fell of three fells on a ridge that starts at Braithwaite and goes west for eight kilometres to conclude at the northern end of Crummock Water. The other two fells on the ridge are Grisedale Pike and Whiteside. The fell is often referred to locally as Hobcarton Pike as it stands at the head of Hobcarton Gill. However, the Ordnance Survey have officially named the fell Hopegill Head on maps after Hope Gill, which is another valley that goes north-west from the summit. Hopegill Head reaches a height of 770 metres (2526 feet) and has two subsidiary summits, Ladyside Pike (703 metres / 2306 feet) and Sand Hill (756 metres / 2480 feet) both of which have Nuttall status. Hopegill Head‚Äôs most striking feature is the 130-metre-high (417-foot-high) cliff of Hobcarton Crag, which drops precipitously to Hobcarton Gill on the fell's north east side. These cliffs are unsuitable for conventional rock climbing because they are made of crumbly Skiddaw Slate but they do provide good winter climbing with the best known routes being Thompson‚Äôs Chimney and Cave Route. The crags, which are owned by the National Trust, are the only location in England of Viscaria alpina, the red alpine catchfly. ==Geology== The laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirkstile Formation predominated, with the underlying greywacke sandstone of the Loweswater Formation outcropping to the north.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) ==Ascents== Hopegill Head can be climbed by various routes. Many people arrive along the ridge from Grisedale Pike or Whiteside but it is also possible to ascend from the Vale of Lorton and from the Whinlatter Pass road by the north west ridge, taking in the subsidiary top of Ladyside Pike. It is also possible to arrive or leave via the Coledale Hause passing over the satellite summit of Sand Hill. This is quite often done as part of the Coledale Round, an 18 kilometre horseshoe walk which takes in the other Coledale fells of Grisedale Pike, Eel Crag, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike. ==Summit== The summit of the fell is an exhilarating place, a small pointed peak poised on the edge of Hobcarton Crag giving wide ranging views. The Isle of Man is seen on clear days, as are the Scottish Border hills. To the east the Helvellyn range is well seen. == References == Looking down the north west ridge to Ladyside Pike, the Whinlatter pass road is in the valley. * A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, The North Western Fells: Alfred Wainwright: * Wainwright‚Äôs Favourite Lakeland Mountains: Alfred Wainwright: * The Mountains of England and Wales, Volume 2, John and Anne Nuttall, ==External links== * Striding Edge Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Hopegill Head"},{"id":"6250251","text":"The Spoils is a collectible card game created by Tenacious Games and owned by Arcane Tinmen since January 2009. It launched with a free open beta in August 2006, and officially released for sale in November 2006. The Spoils was in development from 2001 to 2006. The design team is headed up by Josh Lytle, who also designed the collectible card game Magi-Nation Duel. Jon Finkel, a prominent player in Magic: the Gathering's Pro Tour, aided the development team as an advisor since 2002. The Spoils Card Game, while under the design direction of Ken Pilcher, won the Fan Favorite Origins Award for Best Collectible Card Game at the 2015 Origins Game Fair, beating other contenders including Legend of the Five Rings and Magic: The Gathering. ==Gameplay== The Spoils uses a number of mechanics in common with other collectible card games. Unlike many games of this kind, you start the game with a Faction card in play, which determines how you begin your turn and which actions you are allowed to take. These Factions have special abilities, unique to each Faction card. Currently, 6 Faction cards are available to the public. Special foiled versions of this card were given away at Gen Con. Players need to amass Resource cards in order to play other cards. Certain cards are \\"Staple\\" Resources and any number of these may be played in a deck. As of the Seed Cycle, there is a rare Resource for each trade.Spoiler for Seed Cycle 1, \\"Seed: Children of the Lingamorph\\" card spoiler list. The Factions count as Staples as well, according to the bottom of the card. However, since these are set apart at the beginning of the game or whenever you shuffle your deck, the word Staple tends to refer to Resources. Most cards require between 1 and 4 of these Staple Resources in play to meet the threshold indicated by Resource icons on cards. The Resource icons come in the form of five trades. To supplement the Staple Resources, players may play any card from their hand face down as a Resource; however, cards played face down in this manner will not count towards the Resource threshold. Playable cards come in several types, not counting Staples: Characters, Items, Tactics, and Locations. Each of these types often have subtypes. To win the game, the opponent's Faction must be reduced to 0 influence. The Tournament Faction starts with 25 influence. The Faction's influence may be reduced by attacking it with Characters, or by using Tactics or special abilities. Characters have three stats: Strength (amount of damage the Character deals), Life (amount of damage needed to destroy the Character), and Speed (faster Characters deal their damage earlier).http://www.thespoils.com/spoils/ The combat system is simple in design, but with the ability to have multiple attacks during a turn, the party system and speed mechanic, the game allows for a deep and rewarding strategic decision tree that is \\"easy to lean, but difficult to master\\". The game was officially announced dead in the official sites forums after one of the companies key investors unexpectedly backed out and they could not find additional investors for the product in time to keep up with their release and tournament schedule. This occurred in early 2008 during the 2007-2008 economic crisis. On 20 January 2009, the company Arcane Tinmen have purchased the rights to The Spoils, and hired several members of Tenacious Games as well as Ken Pilcher to resume production.http://www.thespoils.com/spoils/view.php?pg=article_new_era Fantasy Flight Games is the US distributor of Arcane Tinmen and had a viral marketing campaign at Gen Con 2009 about Spoils including T-shirts and promo cards. ==Storyline and setting== The Spoils' storyline takes place in a world very different from our own, best described as \\"dark, absurdist fantasy.\\" First Edition is set \\"150 years after the fall of the Marmothoan Empire.\\" The Seed Cycle will take place 150 years prior to First Edition, presumably during the Fall of the Marmothoan Empire. Future sets following the release of the Seed Cycle will return to the time of First Edition.The Spoils ===Trades=== The Spoils cards are designated by various types and trades. *Banker (Greed icon): As a trade, the Bankers are heavy influence gainers and spenders, and are not known for their COVERT Characters. For instance, playing Concealed Goon (a COVERT Character) will cost you 5 influence, whereas playing Nasty Butler (a low-speed Character) will gain you 4 influence. Bankers also like to draw a lot of cards (using either Cash Out or Beatrix Winterbottom), and have direct Character removal with some benefit to/choice made by their opponents (Irresistible Bribe being an example). *Rogue (Deception icon): As a trade, Rogues try to use their opponent's discard pile against them. And the way they facilitate this is to discard their opponent's library. One particular Character, Pluck, can snatch opponent's discarded Characters, Items or Locations for his controller's use. But it doesn't end in the discard pile; Rogues can take control of some cards their opponents control (an example of a Tactic of this type is Rapine). Some other traits of this trade are high-speed Characters, Speed manipulation, and removing opponent's discard cards from the game, as well as minor control (two examples being the Item Emergency Obfuscation and the Tactic Forced Recruitment). *Warlord (Rage icon): As a trade, Warlords are the straightforward beaters and damage-dealers. They want to lay down efficient (strength to cost ratio) Characters to attack with while using damage dealing sources to clear the way. They also have cards that will help them to overwhelm their opponents with a sizable board control. They also have one of the most powerful Characters, the Dragon Tank, which destroys one enemy Character per turn and is a 10/10/4 as well, thus clearing the enemies away and doing tremendous damage. *Gearsmith (Elitism icon): As a trade, Gearsmiths use cost reduction in many ways to help spur them ahead (with cards such as Jo Ciendeilio and 1337! aiding them in this endeavour). As well as possessing selective tutoring (drawing specific types of cards), the highest number of Item cards, and Character token creator cards (called Micromajigs, with the stats 1/1/3), they have a \\"Node\\" theme that can become quite powerful but is particularly vulnerable. *Arcanist (Obsession icon): As a trade, the Arcanists sport the most COVERT Characters. They can bounce their opponent's permanents and force them to discard cards (using cards such as Forget and Degenerate Molestation), as well as generate tokens that can be used from certain cards to bounce cards (such as Quotidian Ejector) or cause their opponent to discard cards. Another ability of these arcane experimenters is to manipulate the libraries and to retrieve specific \\"type\\" cards (an example being Servile Centipede, which, on coming into play from your hand, allows you to search for a Tactic). ==The Spoils Tournament Experience== From August 1, 2006 through the October, 2006 launch date of The Spoils, Tenacious Games supported the release of a limited set of Open Beta cards of The Spoils Tournament Card Game with over 1000 free tournaments and over $60,000 in prize money. In 2007, sanctioned tournament play was officially titled The Spoils Tournament Experience and given an official overall prize total of US$1,000,000.00. Under the management of Arcane Tinmen, tournaments have begun to spring about again. Although none of them have had prize support nearly as grand as the original $1,000,000.00 tournament that Tenacious had originally sponsored, several tournaments have been held in conventions such as the annual World Championships at Gen Con, Origins Game Fair, Dragon Con, Tidewater Comic Con, and MegaCon.http://thespoilscardgame.com/news-events/ Within Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Chile, Germany, and other countries, Arcane Tinmen has launched a new players promotion & championships which are composed of a series of events. ==Sets and cycles== To date there have been nine sets released between Tenacious Games and Arcane Tinmen. Beta was a limited edition set that was a precursor to 1st Edition. 1st Edition, and 1st Edition Part 2 was combined and reprinted at a later date as the 'core' set, or 2nd Edition. Seed I, II, and III have been combined and reprinted, along with over forty new cards and alternate artwork, as Seed Saga: The Descent of Gideon (formerly codenamed \\"Andreessen\\") {  - !

Shade (for short) is the first of 3 sets in the Unlikely Heroes block. The Shade set was released on Oct 5, 2013 and is 130 cards. The set was sold in 13 card booster packs and contained commons, uncommons, rares and foils (premium cards). The second set in the \\"Unlikely Heroes\\" cycle, Holy Heist, was released in April 2015. The next set, Seed Saga: The Descent of Gideon was released on August 22, 2015 worldwide. The last set of the Unlikely Heroes Block, Ungodly Mess, was released in May 2016. ==Pop culture references== The Spoils is notable for its tongue-in-cheek style, most noticeable in its art and flavour text. An example would be A Series of Tubes: the artwork depicts a mass of large tubes connected together at certain points, and with a small sign beside them with a picture of a dump-truck inside a red forbidden circle, in reference to the Series of Tubes speech. The flavour text also reads \\"It's not a dump-truck.\\" The Gearsmiths have some of the most obvious references, with cards such as 1337!. As well as that, most of their flavour text is written in 1337, especially on the 31f cards like 3p1ph4ny 31f. ==References ;Official sites *The Spoils.com The Spoils Official site.

It is attended by 1,979 students of grades nine through twelve. The mascot is a Buccaneer and strongly resembles the old logo of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ==HistoryDaytona Public School=== The original Daytona Public School, located on Palmetto Avenue. The original school was known as Daytona Public School, and was not a permanent structure. Originally started in 1872 as a school for all grades, the school started off in a log cabin, moved several times, and then finally settled in the wood- frame building pictured on the right in 1874. In 1910, the school was moved to a permanent building until 1925. It was during this time that the first sports program was started in 1912. This school served both junior and senior high school students. The mascot of the time was the Panther and the school colors were Silver and Blue. ===Daytona High School=== In 1926, the school was moved to a new campus on Third Avenue. It had an initial enrollment of 400 students, but quickly expanded to near capacity. It is at this time that the mascot is changed to the Buccaneer and the school colors are changed to Blue and Gold. In 1946 the name was changed to the current school name. This campus lasted until 1962. ===Mainland High School=== In 1962, the school was moved yet again to the current property of the school at the intersection of International Speedway Boulevard. and Clyde Morris Boulevard. Unlike the previous centralized designs, this school was spread out into long buildings in a row, with open hallways. This design was used to increase natural air flow from the ocean, as the school did not have air conditioning until the 1980s. Some of the buildings were later expanded, and a few new buildings were added to accommodate for technology and demand for more classes. Portables were added behind the school to meet the demand for more classrooms. This school was in use until 2010. ===\\"New Mainland\\"=== The \\"new\\" Mainland High School, as viewed in the courtyard. This school finished construction in 2006 The current school, which now faces International Speedway Boulevard, was built by 2006. As air conditioning was no longer a concern, the design went back to being centralized, with the five main buildings centered around a large courtyard. The improvement was aided by a $6 million gift from notable alumnus and professional basketball player Vince Carter. ==Academies== Mainland, like many other schools in Volusia County, has several \\"academies.\\" Academies are special programs of study that focus a student's education on a specific subject. Mainland has five academies: the Academy of Science and Medicine, the Academy of Communications and Multimedia Technology (ACMT), the Academy of Drafting and Manufacturing Technology (ADMT), the Sports Science Academy (SSA), and the Academy of Simulation and Robotics (ASR). These academies entitle graduating students to a special diploma upon completion of the program. ===Academy of Science & Medicine=== ASM is Mainland's largest academy. It is the science and medicine academy. Students are required to take two extra math courses, five extra science courses, along with a computer science course prior to graduation. Beginning with students that enter during the 2008‚Äì2009 School year, the name will gradually be phased to \\"ASM\\", or the Academy of Science and Medicine, with the engineering track being removed, and more emphasis being placed on the medical and environmental aspects of the scientific field. ===Academy of Communications and Multimedia Technology=== The Academy of Communications and Multimedia Technology focuses mainly on computer-related career subjects, such as digital design, network design and maintenance, web design, yearbook production, and television production. ===Academy of Design and Manufacturing Technology=== The Academy of Design and Manufacturing Technology focuses on preparing students for a career in the fields of technology development, architecture, engineering, manufacturing, computer aided manufacturing, electronics, interior design, and construction. This academy uses technology such as: Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor Pro and milling and CNC machines. ===Sports Science Academy=== The Sports Science Academy covers everything in sports besides the athletics. This includes First Aid and medical care, athletic training, and sports administration. ===Academy of Simulation and Robotics=== The Academy of Simulation and Robotics (ASR) debuted in the 2007-2008 school year. Students attracted to robotics, video game design and programming, and computer science can learn about these amazing fields and can develop the skills and knowledge needed to find jobs in the industry. Programming is taught using the Java programming language in computer science classes and Ruby in game programming classes. ==Sports and organizations== Mainland has several clubs and sports to choose from, which cover a wide variety of fields of interest. ===Sports=== Mainland currently has the following sports teams: *Baseball *Bowling *Basketball *Cross Country *Flag Football *Football *Golf *Soccer *Softball *Swimming *Tennis *Track & Field *Volleyball *Weightlifting *Wrestling ==Awards== (see reference below) *National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence: 1983, 1991, 1996 *Redbook Magazine's \\"Best Overall High School in Florida\\": 1992, 1996 *Florida's Governors Council Award for Model Physical Fitness Program: 1995 *Florida Five Star School, for outstanding business partnership and parent participation: 1995-1998 *Internet Science and Technology Fair National Winners: 1999-2003, 2006-2011 ===Grants=== *U.S. Department of Education Technology Grant: 1997 *New Millennium High School Grant: 2001 *NCTM Edward G.

He served for nine terms, representing the Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth district, which includes Avon, Braintree Precincts 1A, 1B, 2A & 2B, Canton, East Bridgewater Precinct 4, Easton Precincts 3-6, Milton, Randolph, Sharon Precincts 2 & 3, Stoughton, and West Bridgewater. On February 23, 2016, Joyce announced that he would not seek re-election to the Massachusetts State Senate for the next term. ==Senate career== During his tenure in the Senate, Joyce distinguished himself as a fierce advocate for the rights of disabled children and elderly citizens. He was credited with securing hundreds of millions of dollars for public schools in his district, and he was instrumental in the revitalization of the Neponset River and Blue Hills reservations. Joyce voted against public opinion on several major issues. In 2004, after Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, Joyce preserved equal marriage rights by filibustering a bill that would have banned same-sex marriage. At the time, Joyce explained his decision by stating that \\"I believe in an America where no religious body seeks to impose its will, directly or indirectly. Tradition as a rationale for discrimination is not persuasive.\\" Brian Joyce strongly opposed the Judge Rotenberg Center during his tenure in office, and tried repeatedly to use his influence to shut it down. The Judge Rotenberg Center has been condemned for torture by the United Nations special rapporteur on torture. ===Committee memberships=== During his last term in office, Joyce served on the following committees: * Chair, Special Senate Committee to Improve Government * Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Redistricting * Joint Committee on Health Care Financing ==Ethics probes and criminal investigations== On February 17, 2016, the FBI and IRS conducted a raid at Joyce's Washington Street law office. Joyce was under scrutiny for various ethical improprieties alleged by Boston Globe reporters, including having his campaign fund pay for his son's high school graduation party and accepting free or discounted services from a dry cleaner in Randolph, Massachusetts. According to the FBI, the raid was part of a federal investigation, though no charges have been filed at that time. The nature of the raid has again raised recurring questions about the close relationship between the Boston Globe and the office of Boston's U.S. Attorney, Carmen Ortiz. Many of the Globe's allegations were proven inaccurate by other journalists, who expressed concern that the Globe may have knowingly printed misleading stories about Joyce. During the winter of 2016, The Boston Globe reported that the federal government has seated a grand jury to look into Joyce's conduct. == Federal indictment == In December 2017, Joyce was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges he collected over $1 million in bribes and kickbacks that he laundered through his law office and another personal business. Legal experts have expressed doubt over the merit of the charges against Joyce, and many of the governments' allegations were later disproven. Prosecutors' attempt to disqualify Joyce's attorney was met with alarm by members of the Boston legal community, who viewed it as an unprecedented infringement on a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. The ACLU, along with the Massachusetts Bar Association and dozens of individual Massachusetts attorneys, jointly filed an amici curiae brief defending Joyce's Constitutional right to counsel and rebuking the Government for its overreach.https://www.massbar.org/docs/default-source/publications-document- library/ejournal/2017-18/04-02-18-joyce-motion-and- brief.pdf?Status=Temp&sfvrsn;=2 The conduct of federal prosecutors in the case has exacerbated ongoing concerns over the legal ethics of the Boston U.S. Attorney's Office. Joyce pleaded not guilty in December 2017 to charges including racketeering, money laundering, mail fraud, conspiracy and scheming to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Joyce was released on a $250,000 bond. The 102-page indictment accuses Joyce of turning his law office into a criminal enterprise, going so far as to accept hundreds of pounds of free coffee from a local Dunkin' Donuts owner. In January 2018, Joyce's former accountant, John Nardozzi, was indicted on federal charges that he helped prepare and file false tax returns for Joyce, misclassifying over $2 million of personal expenses as business expenses, in order to reduce Joyce's tax burden. In October 2019, Nardozzi was convicted by a jury of helping Joyce cheat the IRS out of approximately $600,000 in tax payments, and in January 2020, Nardozzi was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. On October 8, 2018, US Attorney Andrew Lelling announced that he had dismissed all criminal charges against Joyce, in light of his untimely death. ==Background and education== Joyce was born in Winchester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Milton High School in 1980. He received his bachelor's degree from Boston College School of Management in 1984, and he graduated magna cum laude from Suffolk University Law School in 1990. He practiced law in Milton, Massachusetts. ==Death== In the early morning hours of September 26, 2018, Joyce was involved in a single car crash when he reportedly swerved to avoid hitting a deer, crashing through a telephone pole, and finally stopping after hitting a fence. On September 27, 2018, Joyce was found dead in his home in Westport, with no foul play suspected. On December 4, 2018, Massachusetts state medical examiner's office reported Joyce's death was caused by an overdose of pentobarbital and ruled the manner of death was \\"acute pentobarbital intoxication\\" and remains undetermined, pending a ‚Äúthorough death investigation.‚Äù ==Personal life== Joyce was a lifelong resident of Milton, Massachusetts, where he lived with his wife, Mary. They had five children. ==References * Senator Brian A.

He was a member of the Republican Party. ==Early life and business career== Amory Houghton Jr. (1837‚Äì1909), his father Alanson B. Houghton was born on October 10, 1863, in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He was the son of Ellen Ann (Bigelow) and Amory Houghton, Jr. (1837‚Äì1909), who would later be President of the Corning Glass Works, the company founded by Alanson's grandfather Amory Houghton, Sr. in 1851. In 1868, his family moved to Corning, New York. He attended the Corning Free Academy in Corning and St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Houghton graduated from Harvard University in 1886 and then pursued postgraduate courses in Europe. He attended graduate school in G√∂ttingen, Berlin, and Paris until 1889. Upon his return to Corning in 1889, Houghton began work for his family's business, Corning Glass Works. He served as Vice President of the company from 1902 to 1910, and as the company's president from 1910 to 1918. Under Houghton's leadership, the company tripled in size to become one of the largest producers of glass products in the United States. The company manufactured 40% of incandescent light bulbs and 75% of the railway signal glass used in the U.S. Houghton's interest in and promotion of education, particularly in western New York state, led to his being appointed a trustee of Hobart College in 1917. He was a member of the Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia, along with J.P. Morgan and William Rockefeller among others. ==Politics== Houghton was a presidential elector in 1916, voting for the Republican candidates Charles Evans Hughes and Charles W. Fairbanks.ELECTORS FORGET THE LAW in The New York Times on November 27, 1916 In 1918, Alanson B. Houghton defeated incumbent Congressman Harry H. Pratt in the Republican primary. He went on to win the general election and joined the Sixty-sixth Congress, representing New York's 37th Congressional District. In 1920, Houghton garnered 68% of the vote to win reelection over Democrat Charles R. Durham and Socialist Francis Toomey. Houghton took office on March 4, 1919. During his two terms in the House, Houghton served on the Foreign Affairs and Ways and Means committees. ==Diplomacy== Houghton, having studied in prewar Germany, admired German culture and understood German politics. His appointment was approved by the U.S. Senate and well received by the Weimar Republic. On February 28, 1922, Houghton resigned his House seat to accept appointment from President Warren G. Harding as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Houghton believed that world peace, European stability, and American prosperity depended upon a reconstruction of Europe's economy and political system. He saw his role as promoting American political engagement with Europe. He overcame domestic opposition, and disinterest in Washington. He quickly realized that the central issues of the day were all entangled in economics, especially war debts owed by the Allies to the United States, reparations owed by Germany to the Allies, worldwide inflation, and international trade and investment. Solutions, he believed, required new policies by Washington and close cooperation with Britain and Germany. He was a leading promoter of the Dawes Plan.Jeffrey J. Matthews, Alanson B. Houghton: ambassador of the new era (2004) pp 48‚Äì49. On February 24, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Houghton as the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. Houghton assumed the post on April 6, 1925, and served until April 27, 1929. Houghton's service in both Germany and England gave him a unique ability to address the issue of the war reparations Germany owed to its World War I opponents, England being one of them. Houghton laid some of the groundwork for the Dawes Plan, named after then U.S. Vice President Charles G. Dawes, who would be Houghton's successor as Ambassador to Great Britain. In 1928, Houghton ran for the U.S. Senate from New York against first-term incumbent Royal S. Copeland, a Democrat. Houghton lost by just over one percentage point. ==Death and legacy== After his loss in the 1928 Senate race, Houghton returned to managing the Corning Glass Works. He was a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, serving as Chairman until his death in 1941. He also was an original standing committee member of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles and served as vice president of the American Peace Society, which publishes World Affairs, the oldest U.S. journal on international relations. Houghton died at his summer home in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, on September 15, 1941. He was interred at Hope Cemetery Annex in Corning, New York. During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor. Houghton's son, Amory Houghton (1899‚Äì1981), served as the United States Ambassador to France (1957‚Äì1961) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His grandson, Amo Houghton, was a U.S. Congressman from New York from 1987 until 2005. ==See also== * List of covers of Time magazine (1920s) ‚Äì April 5, 1926 * The Harvard Monthly ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Matthews, Jeffrey J.

In 2009 Francesco Fonti, a former 'Ndrangheta member, claimed that Ilaria Alpi and her cameraman were murdered because they had seen toxic waste shipped by the 'Ndrangheta arrive in Bosaso, Somalia.Establishment hit by fresh accusations in toxic waste scandal, by Phillip Willan, The Herald, September 20, 2009 At the time of her murder, she was following a case of weapon and illegal toxic waste traffic in which she believed also the Italian Army and other institutions were involved. Alpi was born in Rome and worked for Italian public television broadcaster RAI. In the 2002 movie Ilaria Alpi - Il pi√π crudele dei giorni, directed by Ferdinando Vincentini Ornagni, she is portrayed by Giovanna Mezzogiorno. ==Biography== After graduating at the high school gymnasium \\"Titus Lucrezio Caro\\" of Rome, she graduated in literature after completing language courses and Islamic culture in the Department of Oriental Studies of the Sapienza University of Rome. Thanks to the excellent knowledge of languages (Arabic, French, English) won the first journalist writing from Cairo on behalf of Paese Sera and L'Unit√†. Later she won a scholarship to be taken to Rai. She is buried in the Cemetery Flaminio in Rome. ==Death== On March 20, 1994, she and Miran Hrovatin were killed in an ambush on their jeep in Mogadishu by a seven-man commando unit after returning from Bosaso, while they were in Mogadishu reporting for Rai 3. In 2000, Somali citizen Hashi Omar Hassan was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for the double murder. In October 2016, a court in Perugia, Italy, reversed the conviction and Hassan was awarded more than three million euros for the wrongful conviction and nearly 17 years he had spent in prison. On 20 March 2014, 20 years after their deaths, the Italian government reportedly authorized the declassification of secret files into their deaths. ==In memory of Ilaria Alpi== Since 1995, awards each year in Riccione the Ilaria Alpi Award to the best Italian television investigations devoted to the issues of peace and solidarity. The 2003 film Ilaria Alpi - Il pi√π crudele dei giorni of Ferdinando Vicentini Orgnani recounts this tragic story. In 1997, the Gang have dedicated the song Chi ha ucciso Ilaria Alpi? (Who killed Ilaria Alpi?), while in 2010 the Pooh wrote the song Reporter, poignant ballad on the album Dove comincia il sole dedicated to Ilaria and her illustrious colleague, Oriana Fallaci. In 2007 he made his debut at the Prize Ilaria Alpi's monologue civil theater \\"The Holiday\\" which reconstructs the case of Ilaria and Miran.

An association may have elected leaders and voluntary dues. Some neighborhood associations in the United States are incorporated, may be recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, and may enjoy freedom from taxation from their home state.Association Types \\"Advocate Property Management\\", Retrieved December 8, 2014. The term neighborhood association is sometimes incorrectly used instead of homeowners association. But neighborhood associations are not homeowners associations - groups of property owners with the legal authority to enforce rules and regulations that focus on restrictions and building and safety issues. A neighborhood association is a group of neighbors and business owners who work together for changes and improvements such as neighborhood safety, beautification and social activities. They reinforce rules and regulations through education, peer pressure and by looking out for each other. Some key differences include: * HOA membership is mandatory generally through rules tied to the ownership of property like deed restrictions. Neighborhood association membership is voluntary or informal. * HOAs often own and maintain common property, such as recreational facilities, parks, and roads, whereas neighborhood associations are focused on general advocacy and community events. The rules for formation of a neighborhood association in the United States are sometimes regulated at the city or state level. Neighborhood councils within a city, whose officers are generally elected, are composed of various neighborhood associations and, as such, may be subject to limitations and special rules set up by the council. Neighborhood associations are more likely to be formed in older, established neighborhoods, especially those that predate HOAs. HOAs are generally established at the time a residential neighborhood is built and sold. Sometimes older established neighborhoods form an HOA to help regulate rules and standards. In some cases, neighborhood associations exist simultaneously with HOAs, and each may not encompass identical boundaries. In one example, newer infill neighborhoods built decades after the original, surrounding HOA-less neighborhood may have its own HOA but also be within the boundaries of a NA. ==Grassroots and straddler organizations== While neighborhood associations in the United States often function in a similar manner, other areas of the world demonstrate different forms of neighborhood associations. These may share basic characteristics with traditional grassroots organizations but yet often remain distinctly different. Benjamin Read refers to this variety of organizations as \\"straddlers for their spanning of the state-society divide.\\" Neighborhood Associations in terms of grassroots organizations compared to straddler organizations can be distinguished by the following characteristics: Grassroots * Ultra local level * Citizens‚Äô organizations * Ideas are authentic & pure * Driven by community volunteers * Develop naturally & spontaneously * Autonomous from government and politics Neighborhood-based Straddler organizations * East & Southeast Asia * Extensive grassroots presence * Engage widespread participation * Linked to state rather than independent of it * Governments actively shape their citizens' lives To expand on the variety of global neighborhood associations present, an example can be used from certain NAs in Asia. ==Neighborhood association frameworks in Asia== There exists four general frameworks to understanding how a local organization, such as a neighborhood association, may straddle the state- society realm. They are: * Civil Society Theory ‚Äì Local citizens' groups are autonomous from government * Mass organizations ‚Äì Ultimate government control; ruling party dominates specific sectors of society * Corporatism ‚Äì State structuring of societal interests * State-Society Synergy-Evans, P. 1996. Government Action, Social Capital and Development: Reviewing the Evidence on Synergy. World Development, 24(6): 1119-1132. Government and communities partner to enhance each other's efforts The relationship between the states and the various forms of neighborhood association may also be identified by its level of statism. Mass organizations would be considered the most statist, where the local associations are closely linked to the state. The Civil Society theory is considered the least statist and here the local associations are extremely self-reliant. Between the most and least statist points are corporatist and state-society synergy; they operate with government and depend on its sponsorship but remain free from direct control. China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand provide examples of how the four frameworks and statism levels play a role in guiding the overall purpose and ultimate goal of the neighborhood-based organizations in each county. ==See also== * Community association * Homeowners association * Neighborhood * Neighborhood Watch * Community league * Comparison of Home Owners' and Civic Associations * Ch≈çnaikai ==References== Category:Neighborhood associations fr:Association de quartier ja:Áî∫ÂÜÖ‰ºö ","title":"Neighborhood association"},{"id":"6250387","text":"Rob Wilson (born 1973) better known by his stage name Fresh I.E. is a Christian rap artist from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

He served in the US navy, where he became an officer. He then began work as a parole officer with youthful offenders. He would later claim that this one and a half year period ignited his interest in personality psychology. https://www.hoganassessments.com/we- dont-build-bridges-from-instinct-an-interview-with-dr-robert-hogan/ ==Education and career== Hogan earned a Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley. He was McFarlin Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology at The University of Tulsa from 1982 to 2001. Prior to that, Hogan was Professor of Psychology and Social Relations at Johns Hopkins University. He has received a number of research and teaching awards and is president and co- founded Hogan Assessment Systems in 1987, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. == Hogan Assessment Systems == Hogan Assessment Systems was the first startup to scientifically measure personality for business. Today it offers products and services in 56 countries and 47 languages. https://www.peoplemattersglobal.com/article/leadership/top-contributions-of- dr-robert-hogan-in-the-field-of-psychology-20004 ==Research== Hogan has contributed to the development of socio-analytic theory, which maintains that the core of personality is based on evolutionary adaptations. Humans, in this view, always live in groups and groups always demonstrate status hierarchies. This in turn leads to two further generalizations: people are motivated to get along with other group members but also to get ahead (to enjoy the prequisites of status). Hogan, an iconoclastic observer of American psychology, maintains that personality is best examined from the perspective of the observer (reputation) rather than the actor (a person's identity). As a consequence, Hogan has insisted that personality tools should be evaluated in terms of how well reputations (defined on personality tests) predict behavior on the job and in relationships.{{https://artsandsciences.utulsa.edu/time-magazine-tu- professor/} Hogan is the author of more than 300 journal articles, chapters and books. His book Personality and the Fate of Organizations was published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates in June 2006. The 167-page book offers a systematic account of the nature of personality, showing how to use personality to understand organizations, to staff teams, and to evaluate, select, deselect and train people. He is the co-editor of the Handbook of Personality Psychology and has published the Hogan Personality Inventory, the Hogan Development Survey, the Motives Values and Preferences Inventory, and the Hogan Business Reasoning Inventory, as well as the Hogan Guide (2007). In 2012 he and Gordon Curphy authored The Rocket Model, a practical model for building and managing high-performing teams. In 1994, Hogan was one of 52 signatories on \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence\\",Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p A18. an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to the controversy about intelligence research that followed the publication of the book The Bell Curve.http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and the Society for Industrial/Organizational Psychology. == Awards and Recognition == Dr. Hogan was deemed by his peers to be one of the world's greatest living psychologists for his contributions to personality psychology.

RATS is developed and sold by Estima, Inc., located in Evanston, IL. ==History== The forerunner of RATS was a FORTRAN program called SPECTRE, written by economist Christopher A. Sims. SPECTRE was designed to overcome some limitations of existing software that affected Sims' research in the 1970s, by providing spectral analysis and also the ability to run long unrestricted distributed lags. The program was then expanded by Tom Doan, then of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who added ARIMA and VAR capabilities and went on to found the consulting firm that owns and distributes RATS software. In its early incarnations, RATS was designed primarily for time series analysis, but as it evolved, it acquired other capabilities. With the advent of personal computers in 1984, RATS went from being a specialty mainframe program to an econometrics package sold to a much broader market. ==Features== RATS is a powerful program, which can perform a range of econometric and statistical operations. The following is a list of the major procedures in econometrics and time series analysis that can be implemented in RATS. All these methods can be used in order to forecast, as well as to conduct data analysis. In addition, RATS can handle cross-sectional and panel data: * Linear regression, including stepwise. * Regressions with heteroscedasticity and serial-correlation correction. * Non-linear least squares. * Two-stage least squares, three-stage least squares, and seemingly unrelated regressions. * Non-linear systems estimation. * Generalized Method of Moments. * Maximum likelihood estimation. * Simultaneous equation systems, large econometric models. * ARIMA (autoregressive, integrated moving average) and transfer function models. * Spectral analysis. * Kalman filter and State Space models. * Neural networks. * Regressions with discrete dependent variables, such as logistic regressions. * ARCH and GARCH models. * Vector autoregressions. RATS can read data from a variety of file formats and database sources, including Excel files, text files, Stata files, and most databases that support SQL and ODBC. It can handle virtually any data frequency, including daily, weekly, intra-day, and panel data. RATS has extensive graphics capabilities. It can generate high-resolution time series graphs, high-resolution X-Y scatter plots, dual-scale graphs, and can export graphs to many formats, including PostScript and Windows Metafile. ==Mode of operation== RATS can be run interactively, or in batch mode. In the interactive mode, the user can run existing programs, or perform new tasks either by using menu-driven \\"wizards\\" or by typing in commands directly (or a combination of both approaches). The menu-driven wizards automatically generate the corresponding commands, allowing users to interactively construct complete programs that can be saved and re-run later. New users often prefer the interactive mode, while experienced users will often prefer to run batch jobs. After an interactive session, the code can be saved, and converted to a batch format. One advantage of RATS, as opposed to automated forecasting software, is that it is an actual programming language, which enables the user to design custom models, and change specifications. Recent versions have added report-generation tools designed to facilitate accurate exporting of results for use in papers and other documents. ==Comparison with other software== One advantage of the RATS program is that it is inexpensive, compared to larger programs such as SAS. RATS has many of the same capabilities as SAS in both time series analysis and other advanced statistical methods. The two programs differ more in the details than in capabilities. SAS has routines for automated State Space estimation. RATS can be programmed to estimate State Space models, or regression models with time-varying coefficients. In this respect, RATS is actually more flexible. Similarly, SAS has an entire routine for estimating and forecasting with Unobserved Components Models. In RATS, estimation of this type would require extensive programming. Nevertheless, in general, the capabilities of RATS are comparable to SAS/ETS and SAS/STAT, but at a much lower price. ==See also== * Comparison of statistical packages ‚Äì includes information on RATS features ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Estima * RATS Discussion Forum Category:Econometrics software Category:Regression and curve fitting software Category:Time series software Category:Proprietary commercial software for Linux ","title":"RATS (software)"},{"id":"6250486","text":"The North Pole by Submarine is the first and only album released by ambient techno artist Bleep.

It was opened in 1929 as the first mixed grammar school in Surrey and now has over 1900 pupils aged 11‚Äì18 (Years 7-13). ==History== Oxted County School, as named until 1999 when it became known as Oxted School, was built in 1929 at the cost of ¬£35,000. In its first term it had only 22 pupils but this increased to 120 after two years. It was originally designed to grow to 250 pupils. Now, as of 2019 it has well in excess of 1900 pupils. The school was the first mixed grammar school in Surrey when it opened. The sexes were strictly segregated and they had separate staircases, playgrounds and had to sit at separate sides of the classroom in lessons. As a punishment, girls would have to write lines; boys were caned by the headmaster. In September 2013, following the departure of Mr Guy Nelson as headteacher, the chairman of the school's governing body announced new leadership arrangements for the school.http://www.oxted.surrey.sch.uk/_files/Letters%20Home/0ABA4CA1D1928892450DF890CD363469.pdf Mrs Rhona Barnfield, currently Executive Head of the Howard Partnership, an Academy Chain in Surrey comprising Howard of Effingham School near Leatherhead and Thomas Knyvett College at Ashford, was appointed Executive Head of Oxted School. Mrs Nicola Euridge, also from the Howard Partnership, was appointed Head of School, and made responsible for running the school on a day-to-day basis. The Howard Partnership forms part of the Howard Partnership Education Trust, to which is also linked the Howard Partnership Trust. In 2014, 68% of the school pupils attained 5 GCSEs grade A* to C including English and Maths; 78% of its students attained 5 GCSEs at grade C and above. In September 2015 the school converted to academy status sponsored by the Howard Partnership. ==ODD Youth Theatre== The school has a performing arts department and its own theatre company called The Odd Youth Theatre. It is run by David Morris, the head of Drama. Having previously been known as The Performing Arts Society, the new name Odd Youth Theatre (Oxted Dance and Drama) was adopted when the company took Dancing In The Dark, adapted from the novel by Joan Barfoot, to The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1992. The company returned to Edinburgh in 1999 with two productions, Find Me and Molly. Recent productions include Under Milk Wood, Oliver, Into the Woods, Guys and Dolls, Sleeping Beauty and West Side Story. The 2012 school production was the acclaimed A Christmas Carol.The most recent play performed by Oxted School, in 2013, was Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Jesus Christ Superstar. The play was performed by the Oxted Students in November and was rated \\"Amazing\\" by the Surrey Mirror. At the last performance David Morris quoted \\"Amazing six standing ovations.\\" 2014 the school play Oh What a lovely war, 2015 Hairspray, 2016 Starlight Express, 2017 Anything Goes and finally 2018 Sister Act. ==Buildings== # The original building of 1929 # The 1951 extension of the original building # The PE Block (1960s) # The Art Block (1987) # The Drama Studio (1991) # The Science Block (1993) # The Design and Technology Block (1997) # The Meridian Building (1999/2000).

It was the most important of the three councils celebrated in Lima during the 16th century, since it definitively organized the Church in the Americas. It was summoned by Archbishop Toribio de Mogrovejo in 1581, and met from 15 August 1582 to 18 October 1583. The Council dictated many regulations and principles, centered on the evangelization of the aboriginals and their fair treatment \\"not like slaves but as free men\\", as well as their education and instruction in European customs. It decreed that the indigenous languages must be used, and forbade the use of Latin and the exclusive use of Spanish. It produced a trilingual catechism (then known as \\"Catechism of St. Toribius\\"), in Spanish, Quechua and Aymara. This catechism was later translated into the Guaran√≠ language by Luis de Bola√±os, and adopted by the First Synod of Asunci√≥n (1603) for use in the area of the Upper Paran√° River basin (eastern Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina). The Council also encouraged the establishment of seminaries. It set standards for the ordination of priests, requiring that they visit their congregations regularly, and for the appropriate use of liturgy to attract the natives to the celebrations. The Council banned and ordered the burning of all Quipus in 1583 because they were used to record offerings to non-Christian gods and were therefore considered idolatrous objects and an obstacle to religious conversion.Frank L.

The Philoclean Society at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey is one of the oldest collegiate literary societies in the United States, and among the oldest student organizations at Rutgers University. Founded in 1825, the society was one of two such organizations-- the other being the Peithessophian Society--on campus devoted to the same purpose. The name Philoclean derives from the Ancient Greek for ‚Äúlover of glory‚Äù from Œ¶ŒπŒªŒµŒπŒΩ meaning \\"to love,\\" and Œ∫ŒªŒµŒøœÇ, meaning ‚Äúglory.‚Äù Woodhouse, S.C. ‚Äò‚ÄôEnglish-Greek Dictionary: A Vocabulary of the Attic Language‚Äô‚Äô (London: George Routledge & Sons, 1910). ==History== The Philoclean Society is one of many literary societies that flourished at the nation's early colonial colleges. Before fraternities, publications, and other extracurricular activities became common, these groups‚Äîwhich generally bore Greek or Latin names‚Äîwere the sole source of undergraduate social life. Indeed, it was not unusual for two or more groups to coexist at one institution, often in competition. Surviving examples include the Philodemic Society at Georgetown University, Union-Philanthropic Society at Hampden-Sydney College, the Philolexian Society at Columbia University, the Philomathean Society of the University of Pennsylvania, the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union and Jefferson Literary and Debating Society at The University of Virginia and the American Whig-Cliosophic Society at Princeton University. The Philoclean Society of Rutgers College was founded 8 December 1825 under the auspices of William Craig Brownlee, a professor of Greek and Roman languages. The rival Peithessophian Society had been started just weeks earlier, enlisting the entire senior class as charter members. Thus, Philoclean's charter membership was of necessity drawn from the junior and sophomore classes which instituted a significant rivalry between the two societies, known as ‚Äò‚ÄôPhilo‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôPeitho‚Äô‚Äô to students and alumni. The society, in its initial form, endured until the 1890s, when along with the Peithessophian Society, closed in 1898.Inventory to the Records of the Philoclean Society of Rutgers College, 1825-1927, accessed 3 August 2006. Several literary societies sought to fill the gap left by the decline of both societies, but a full revival did not begin until 1907 when the Literary Society of Rutgers College was formed, and later took the name ‚ÄúPhiloclean.‚Äù This society was markedly different from the original, chiefly focusing on the discussion of literature, and less attention to debate and oration. However, the society founded the Interscholastic Debating League for secondary schools across three states in 1914, and organized a rival society, the Philalethean Literary Society at the New Jersey College for Women (now Douglass College) in 1920. The society, however, declined and ceased to exist in 1932. The societies engaged in rivalry by acquiring honorary members, who were believed in publicizing their acceptance, to raise the prestige of the society, serving to benefit the society through fundraising, as well as the donation of books and other materials. Honorary members leading historical, political, and literary figures of the nineteenth century, including most notably James Buchanan, Mark Twain, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Thomas Alva Edison, and Frederick T. Frelinghuysen. However, In 1879, when American humorist and author Mark Twain was invited, and accepted honorary membership in the Philoclean Society, he did not render the customary monetary donation.Rutgers: \\"Through the Years\\" (Timeline) , accessed 3 August 2006 In the same capacity that he was only partly accepted as a member of the Rutgers Glee Club, the singer, athlete, Rutgers valediction 1919 and political radical, Paul Robeson was elected to the Philoclean Society in 1917 Duberman, Martin.

The kokoshnik tradition has existed since the 10th century in the ancient Russian city Veliky Novgorod. It spread primarily in the northern regions of Russia and was very popular from 16th to 19th century. It is still to this day an important feature of Russian dance ensembles and folk culture and inspired the Kokoshnik style of architecture. Seven different types of kokoshnik ==Overview== Historically a kokoshnik is a headdress worn by married women, though maidens also wore a headdress very similar to a kokoshnik, but open in the back, named a povyazka. The word kokoshnik describes a great variety of headdresses worn throughout Russia, including the cylindrical hats of Veliky Novgorod, two-pointed nimbus kika of Vladimir, triangular kika of Kostroma, small pearl hats of Kargopol, and scarlet kokoshniks of Moscow. While in the past kokoshnik styles varied greatly, currently a kokoshnik is generally associated with a tall, nimbus or crest shaped headdress which is tied at the back of the head with long thick ribbons in a large bow. The crest can be embroidered with pearls and goldwork or simple applique, usually using plant and flower motifs. The forehead area is frequently decorated with pearl netting. While wearing a kokoshnik the woman usually wears her hair in a plait. The kokoshnik were often also combined with the Russian braid. ==History== Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia Mid 19th century kokoshnik from Middle Russia The word kokoshnik first appears in 16th-century documents, and comes from the Old Slavic kokosh, which means a hen or a cockerel. However, the earliest head-dress pieces of the similar type (rigid cylindrical hat which completely covered the hair) have been found in the 10th- to 12th-century burials in Veliky Novgorod.Primeval Rus': Women's head dress and jewellery The kokoshnik gave its name to the decorative corbel arch that became a distinctive element of traditional Russian architecture from 16th century onwards (see kokoshnik architecture). During the revival of Russian national culture in the early 19th century, diadem-shaped tiaras became part of the official court dress for royalty and for ladies-in-waiting. These \\"kokoshniks\\" were inspired just as much by Italian Renaissance fashions and by the french hood as by the authentic Russian kokoshniks still worn by the middle class and wealthy peasants of the time. In this period both unmarried and married women wore the variety used traditionally by unmarried women: showing the front part of the hair, and with a translucent veil falling down the back. Russian peasant girls and women wore kokoshniks on special occasions until the Russian Revolution. After the Revolution Russian √©migr√©s introduced the kokoshnik to the rest of European fashion. The style had appeared once in the 1893 wedding head-dress of Mary of Teck, the future Queen consort of the United Kingdom. kokoshniks are worn chiefly by girls and women in Russian folk ensembles. A kokoshnik is also a part of the traditional costume of Snegurochka, the granddaughter and assistant of Ded Moroz. Queen Marie of Romania wore a Cartier tiara created to resemble the Russian kokoshnik for her 1924 portrait painted by Philip de L√°szl√≥. The tiara was among the jewels on display in the \\"Cartier: Style and History\\" exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris from December 4 through February 16, 2014.Queen Marie of Romania portrait One of the costumes of Senator Padm√© Amidala in the Star Wars saga, the Gold Travel Costume, was based on the Russian national costume with kokoshnik, known in the rest of Europe from the photographs taken during 1903 Ball in the Winter Palace. Fans of Russia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup were seen wearing simple versions of kokoshniki. In the last years Kokoshniks made out of flowers became also popular. Kokoshniks are a popular Russian souvenir. ==Gallery== Image:Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia in Russian dress by anonim (1790s, Gatchina).jpgA young Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna in kokoshnik and sarafan, 1790s.

The bodies are located in the constellation Scorpius and are about 400 light years away. Mass estimates of the two objects are uncertain, but they are probably each higher than the brown-dwarf/planet dividing line of 13 Jupiter masses. Oph1622B is located 1.94 arcseconds from Oph1622A, at a position angle of 182¬∞. The discovery of the pair was announced in a 2006 Science article by Ray Jayawardhana and Valentin D. Ivanov . The objects were discovered using telescopes of the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope in La Silla, Chile. The masses were originally reported to be lower, at 14 and 7 Jupiter masses, which would have made the smaller object a planetary-mass object, or planemo. The system was announced as the first reported binary system of objects this small. However, later observations and calculations have revised the masses upward. Close et al. estimate the mass of the primary, designated Oph1622A as 12-21 times that of Jupiter and 9-20 Jupiter masses for the less massive Oph1622B, while Luhman et al. assign values of 57 and 20 Jupiter masses. Despite the acronym \\"Oph\\" appearing in its name (implying that it may belong to the young Ophiuchus molecular cloud), Oph1622 is likely to be older than its originally adopted age of 1 million years. More likely, it is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association, which has an age of 11 million years. For an adopted age of 11 million years, the system has inferred masses of 53 and 21 Jupiter masses, similar to that derived by Luhman et al. The distance between the two is approximately 240 AU --a distance so great that Space.com wrote that \\"their connection is so tenuous ... that a passing star or brown dwarf could permanently separate the two objects.\\" As such, the discovery was reported as casting doubt on the theory that such free-floating planet-like objects have been ejected from a stellar system, such an event being too violent to leave them in such a wide orbit around each other. Given their wide separation and high masses, the system is best thought of as a wide brown dwarf binary rather than a binary planetary system. ==See also== * 2M1101AB * UScoCTIO 108 * SDSS J1416+1348 * Binary brown dwarfs ==References * https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060804084105.htm * http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Astronomers_Discover_Twin_Planemos_999.html * http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060803_planemo_twins.html * http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5241774.stm Category:Scorpius (constellation) Category:Brown dwarfs Category:Upper Scorpius ","title":"Oph 162225-240515"},{"id":"6250622","text":"Ian Irving Mitroff (born 1938) is an American organizational theorist, consultant and Professor Emeritus at the USC Marshall School of Business and the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California He is noted for a wide range of contributions in the field of organizational theory from contributions on strategic planning assumptionsMorgan, Gareth, Fred Gregory, and Cameron Roach.

Ian Mitroff is the founder and President of Mitroff Crisis Management. Founded in 1995, this consulting firm is composed of a national network of specialists that conduct projects in crisis management. MCM developed Crisis Management Software, which is an audit program that allows the user to perform crisis audits of their organization. It can be downloaded onto a desktop and is also available in app form. MCM also offers organizations customized workshops that are tailored to the organization's needs based on their crisis audit. It is a one-day course that focuses on critical thinking; the courses that are offered are \\"Systems Thinking and the Error of the Third Kind,\\" \\"Inquiry Systems,\\" and \\"Crisis Management.\\" These workshops are designed to help organizations better their ability to plan and prepare for crises as well as formulate plans to address crises when they occur, and how to learn from and prevent them in the future. MCM also offers an interactive board game, \\"Crisis Prone or Prepared,\\" that walks the user through crisis situations before, during, and after they happen, and how to handle events as they arise. Many top companies, including Dow Chemical, American Red Cross, Hewlett Packard, Los Angeles Police Department, and Kraft General Foods, have utilized MCM's resources.Mitroff Crisis Management official website: http://mitroff.net Mitroff is also the creator of Mitroff's Five Stages of Crisis Management. This model is a comprehensive guide for crisis management and consists of five mechanisms, or stages. The first is Signal Detection. This step details how organizations can prepare for and prevent crises before they occur by closely monitoring for early warning signs of a potential crisis. The second mechanism is Probing and Prevention, or Prevention/Preparedness. The probing aspect involves actively searching for risk factors, and prevention is taking measures to reduce any potential for damage. Damage Containment is exactly what it is named. This step teaches organizations how to properly contain damage caused by a crisis and keep it from spreading and contaminating other areas. Recovery is the second to last step, and this stresses returning to normal operations and systems as soon as it is feasibly possible and appropriate to do so. The last step is Learning. The crisis should be reviewed thoroughly, including how it happened and how the organization handled the crisis. Then the review should be comprehensively analyzed and critiqued so the organization can improve its crisis management skills for inevitable future crises.Paraskevas, A. (2013). Mitroff's five stages of crisis management. In K. Penuel, M. Statler, & R. Hagen (Eds.), Encyclopedia of crisis management. (pp. 629-633). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. Ian Mitroff has authored more than 25 books, but one of his most celebrated works is his book, Managing Crises Before They Happen: What Every Executive Needs to Know about Crisis Management. It is co- authored with Gus Anagnos, and its theme is equipping organizational leaders with the right tools to better prepare for and detect crises before they happen. It begins with a detailed description of what a crisis is and the general components of an effective framework for crisis management. It then differentiates between types of crises and how to manage each one effectively. The book gives instructions and advice on how to detect early warning signs of a crisis and create and utilize crisis scenarios in order to prevent, or if inevitable, prepare for them. Unfortunately crises cannot always be avoided, so Mitroff gives guidelines for organizations to handle them when they arise. Some vital suggestions include always being honest and upfront about the situation and assuming full responsibility. The book is an excellent resource for any organizational leader looking to increase their preparedness for crisis situations and management. ==Selected publications== * Mitroff, Ian I.

Individuals with MWS often have episodic fever, chills, and joint pain. As a result, MWS is considered a type of periodic fever syndrome. MWS is caused by a defect in the CIAS1 gene which creates the protein cryopyrin. MWS is closely related to two other syndromes, familial cold urticaria and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease--in fact, all three are related to mutations in the same gene and subsumed under the term cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). ==Sign and symptoms== *Sensorineural deafness *Recurrent urticaria (hives) *Fevers *Chills *Arthralgia (painful joints) ==Causes== MWS occurs when a mutation in the CIAS1 gene, encoding for NLRP3, leads to increased activity of the protein cryopyrin. This protein is partly responsible for the body's response to damage or infection. During these states, a cytokine called interleukin 1Œ≤ is produced by an innate immune cell known as a macrophage. This cytokine interacts with a receptor on the surface of other immune cells to produce symptoms of inflammation such as fever, arthritis, and malaise. In MWS, the increased activity of cryopyrin leads to an increase in interleukin 1Œ≤. This leads to inflammation all throughout the body with the associated symptoms. ==DiagnosisTreatment== * Treatment with anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, can lead to an improvement in the hearing loss. * Rilonacept (Arcalyst) a dimeric fusion protein for the treatment of CAPS. * Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-1Œ≤ ==Prognosis== The chronic inflammation present in MWS over time can lead to sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, the prolonged inflammation can lead to deposition of proteins in the kidney, a condition known as amyloidosis. ==History== MWS was first described in 1962 by Thomas James Muckle (1938-2014) and Michael Vernon Wells (born 1932). ==Society and culture== The CBC Radio One program, White Coat, Black Art, hosted by Dr. Brian Goldman, presents a real-life study of the self-diagnosis by and successful treatment of a father and daughter with Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome: 24 September 2016 episode In the episode of popular TV series House, the main patient of the Season 7 episode Recession Proof is ultimately diagnosed with this condition.In an episode of TV series Cake Boss, Buddy Valastro works with a girl with this condition through Make-A-Wish Foundation. == See also == * Familial cold urticaria, a similar disease * List of cutaneous conditions * NOMID, a similar disease * Urticarial syndromes * CINCA Syndrome == References  External links == Category:Rheumatology Category:Autoinflammatory syndromes Category:Rare syndromes Category:Genetic syndromes Category:Syndromes with sensorineural hearing loss Category:Syndromes affecting the skin ","title":"Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome"},{"id":"6250637","text":"Cazuela ( or kaÀàswela) is the common name given to a variety of dishes, especially from South America. It receives its name from the cazuela (Spanish for cooking pot) - traditionally, often shallow and of unglazed earthenware - in which it is cooked. The ingredients and preparation vary from region to region, but it is usually a mid-thick flavoured stock obtained from cooking several kinds of meats and vegetables mixed together. == Chilean cazuelas == A Chilean cazuela The cazuela is a typical dish of Chile. The most common types are made of chicken or beef, but there are also other types made from pork and turkey. One typical dish of Chilean cazuela contains a piece of meat (it can be a piece of rib or several pieces of bones, in the case of beef, or a leg of chicken), a potato, a piece of pumpkin, and the stock obtained from boiling all of them together. These are sometimes complemented with cooked rice (in the stock), small-sized noodles, green beans, celery, sliced carrots, garlic, cabbage, among others. In summer the cazuela is accompanied by a piece of sweetcorn, cooked apart or in the same stock. The cazuela is typically eaten by consuming the liquid stock first, then eating the meat and larger vegetables (e.g. potatoes, large piece of squash or carrot) last. However, the meat and larger vegetables can also be sliced up within the liquid stock and can be eaten simultaneously with the liquid stock. The Chilean cazuela is related to the olla podrida, a colonial dish of similar characteristics, but it also shares roots with a Mapuche stock called \\"korr√º\\". == Peruvian cazuela == Cazuela is a typical dish of the Amazonas Region in Peru. The dish is prepared and cooked differently in each province or district of Amazonas. In Chachapoyas, cazuela is prepared by boiling a piece of hen, a good piece of meat and a good piece of sheep. Add some wild cabbage, rice, carrot, sweetcorn grains, and a glass of white wine. A few minutes before taking the saucepot out of the fire, add some milk and vermicelli noodles (also called cabello de √°ngel noodles). It is necessary to try that the cazuela has sufficient broth or juice to be able to be served as a soup. == Puerto Rican cazuela == In Puerto Rico, cazuela is a traditional crustless pie usually made during the Christmas season. It is similar to a pumpkin pie but uses batata (a type of sweet potato), calabasa (Caribbean squash), raisins, ginger, spices, coconut milk, eggs, butter, and bread, flour or rice flour. There are recipes with added sweet plantain, taro, or yuca with baking powder and lard. == Other regional variations == In southern Arizona, cazuela is frequently made with carne seca or machaca (two varieties of dried beef) with potatoes, garlic, green chiles, and herbs. ==See also== * List of soups == References == Category:Chilean soups Category:Peruvian cuisine Category:Puerto Rican cuisine Category:Culture of Amazonas Region ","title":"Cazuela"},{"id":"6250643","text":"Insomnia is the soundtrack album for the 1997 Norwegian film Insomnia, which was composed by ambient artist Biosphere.

Butera is frequently regarded as a crossover artist who performed with equal ease in both R&B; and the post-big band pop style of jazz that permeated the early Vegas nightclub scene. ==Biography== Butera was born and raised in an Italian-American family in New Orleans, where his father, Joe, ran a butcher shop and played guitar in his spare time. He heard the saxophone for the first time at a wedding when he was seven years old, and, with his father's encouragement, he began to play. Butera's professional career blossomed early, beginning with a stint in big band drummer Ray McKinley's orchestra directly after high school. Butera was named one of America's top upcoming jazzmen by Look magazine when he was only eighteen years old, and, by his early twenties, he had landed positions in the orchestras of Tommy Dorsey, Joe Reichman, and Paul Gayten. As the big band era wound down and heavy touring became less common among jazz musicians, Butera re-settled in New Orleans, where he played regularly at the 500 Club for four years. The 500 Club was owned by Louis Prima's brother, Leon, and it was this connection that led him to his much-heralded Vegas-based collaborations with Prima and Smith. Prima transitioned from big band to Vegas somewhat hastily, having signed a contract with the Sahara without having first assembled a back-up band. From his Vegas hotel room, Prima phoned Butera in New Orleans and had him assemble a band posthaste. Butera and the band drove from New Orleans to Las Vegas in such a hurry that they had not taken time to give their act a name. On opening night in 1954, Prima asked Butera before a live audience what the name of his band was. Butera responded extemporaneously, \\"The Witnesses\\", and the name stuck. Butera remained the bandleader of The Witnesses for more than twenty years. During that time, he performed with Louis Prima and/or Keely Smith on such Prima-associated classics as \\"That Old Black Magic\\", \\"Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody,\\" \\"Come on-a My House,\\" and \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" (from Disney's The Jungle Book). Richard and Robert Sherman, composers of the songs from that classic Disney animated film, agreed to cast Prima, Butera and their band after executives from the Walt Disney Company urged them to travel to Las Vegas to witness the band‚Äôs live act in person. Butera is noted for his raucous playing style, his off-color humor, and the innuendo in his lyrics. The arrangement he made with Prima of \\"Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\\" has been covered by David Lee Roth, Los Lobos, Brian Setzer, The Village People, and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. In addition to his accomplishments as a saxophonist and composer, Butera is widely regarded as the inspiration for the vocal style of fellow New Orleans-born jazz singer Harry Connick, Jr. ===Later career=== Butera had a featured role in the Cinemax TV special Viva Shaf Vegas (1986), which starred Paul Shaffer. In the show, written by Shaffer, Tom Leopold and Harry Shearer, Butera is asked to help Shaffer with his \\"spiritual crisis\\". To analyze Shaffer's problem, Butera asks a series of questions, the last of which is, \\"Are you regular?\\" Sam Butera was featured in an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast (1997). Butera's advice for the host on getting \\"chicks, like a fox [insert purr]\\" is, \\"Well, first a little music, a little jive talk. You gotta call her baby, sweetheart, darling, you know all the names that go along with love.\\" When he sang part of \\"Just a Gigolo,\\" the hosts found it familiar and he began to tell how David Lee Roth stole the song from him. \\"I wrote that arrangement thirty four years ago, the one that David Lee Roth stole from me. He came in one night to see me, you know, and after the show he walked up to me and said 'Hey Sam!', and I said 'who are you', he said 'I'm David Lee Roth'\\". \\"'You know what' I tell him? I said 'give me my money' and he turned right away and walked out.\\" Royalties are paid to songwriters, not arrangers, and the 2 songs making up the arrangement were old standards by the 1950's. Butera's anger towards Roth was equaled by his anger towards journalists, often calling columnists to complain about reviews he didn't like. Sam Butera appeared in a Joe Piscopo HBO special. Butera played a part in the movie The Rat Race (1960), starring Debbie Reynolds and Tony Curtis. He played a scam artist along with Joe Bushkin who fleeced Curtis out of his instruments. The music can be heard on the LP and the CD released by Dot as a soundtrack of The Rat Race. Butera died of pneumonia in Las Vegas, Nevada at the age of 81. ==Selected discography== * \\"Goin' In\\" B: \\"Comin' Out\\" 1955 Solo albums with The Witnesses: * The Big Horn (Capitol Records - 1958) * The Big Voice and Big Sax of Sam Butera (Capitol Records - 1959) * The Wildest Clan (Dot Records - 1960) * Plays Music from \\"The Rat Race\\" (Dot Records - 1960) * Apache!

The MIT Department of Physics has over 120 faculty members, is often cited as the largest physics department in the United States, and hosts top-ranked programs. It offers the SB, SM, PhD, and ScD degrees. Fourteen alumni of the department and nine current or former faculty members (two of whom were also students at MIT) have won the Nobel Prize in Physics. ==AcademicsUndergraduate academics=== There are two paths to earning a bachelor's degree (SB) in physics from MIT. The first, \\"Course 8 Focused Option\\", is for students intending to continue studying physics in graduate school. The track offers a rigorous education in various fields in fundamental physics including classical and quantum mechanics, statistical physics, general relativity, electrodynamics, and higher mathematics. The second, \\"Course 8 Flexible Option\\" is designed for those students who would like to develop a strong background in physics but who would like to branch off into other research directions or more unconventional career paths, such as information theory, computer science, finance, and biophysics. A significant part of the student's third and fourth undergraduate years are left open for relevant electives and graduate classes, which then form a specialization. Both tracks have a strong emphasis on laboratory instruction, with the third year often reserved for two \\"Junior Lab\\" courses. Most students partaking in undergraduate research or a research-oriented internship. ===Graduate academics=== The department offers doctoral degrees in the following divisions: astrophysics, atomic and optical physics, biophysics, experimental condensed matter physics, theoretical condensed matter physics, experimental nuclear/particle physics, theoretical nuclear/particle physics, plasma physics, and quantum computing. ==Research== The department is divided into four main research areas, namely a) astrophysics, b) atomic, biophysics, condensed matter, and plasma physics, c) experimental nuclear and particle physics, and d) theoretical nuclear and particle physics.

Photograph is of the original Korean cast. \\"He Lives in You\\" is a song written and performed by Lebo M. and his South African Choir for Rhythm of the Pride Lands, an album inspired by the film The Lion King. It is performed twice in the musical adaptation of the film, and a shorter version of the song was used for the opening of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. The song was co-written by Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin. ==The Lion King musical== The song is used twice in the musical based on the film, once in each act. During the first act, it is sung by Mufasa to young Simba as \\"They Live in You\\". The lyrics were changed slightly to represent the Great Kings of the Past - reference is made to the stars from which the Great Kings of the Past are believed to watch over the world. Mufasa, during the song, shows Simba that he is never alone as there is always someone watching over him. The song is performed by Mufasa and the ensemble and has a reverent and subdued tone throughout. In the second act, the song is sung by Rafiki, the ensemble and adult Simba as \\"He Lives in You\\". The first part of the song is subdued and sung by Rafiki and the ensemble as Rafiki summons Mufasa's spirit. Mufasa's spirit appears and instructs Simba to return home and take his rightful place as king. After Mufasa's spirit fades Simba realizes that he must take responsibility and return home. At this point there is an instrumental break, after which the song becomes livelier and Simba joins in the celebratory singing after realizing his responsibilities as the true king. ==The Lion King II: Simba's Pride== The song is used in the opening sequence of the 1998 film, sung by Lebo M.. Animals are shown traveling to Pride Rock to witness the presentation of Simba and Nala's daughter, Kiara. The main theme of the song is that Mufasa's legacy lives on, despite his death. Mufasa's spirit is also seen watching over the presentation. ==The Lion King (2019 film)== Lebo M. performs a version of the song that plays over the credits of the 2019 version of The Lion King and is included on the film's soundtrack. ==Cover versions== Tina Turner's version was featured on the compilation album The Lion King Collection as well as the credits of the film . Diana Ross recorded the song for her 1999 album, Every Day Is a New Day and for the 1999 movie Double Platinum where her character Olivia King sang it. TRF recorded the song for the Japanese version of Simba's Pride, releasing their version as their 25th single in 1999. Lonnie Gordon recorded a house version for her album No Regret and released it as a single in 2001.

It is one of the main railway hubs of Israel, located in the eastern part of Tel Aviv, on the border between Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. The station was opened to the public in November 1954 under the name Tel Aviv Central, and throughout its history was also widely known as Arlozorov station due to its location in the eastern end of Arlozorov street, Tel Aviv, and next to the Arlozorov Interchange on the Ayalon Highway. Most of Israel Railways' lines (with the exception of Haifa-region suburban trains) make a stop or terminate at the station. It is the busiest heavy-rail train station in the country in terms of passenger movements, serving a daily average of 70,073 passengers in December 2014. It has three island platforms serving a total of six tracks, with another island platform serving future tracks 7 and 8 planned for addition by the late 2020s as part of the four- tracking project of the Ayalon Railway. Tel Aviv Central is located between a large bus terminal to its west and Ramat Gan's Diamond Exchange District to its east. Like all railway stations in Tel Aviv, the tracks lie between the southbound and northbound lanes of the Ayalon Highway. They are connected by escalators, stairways and elevators for disabled persons to a bridge which links them to the terminal building (on the Tel Aviv side) and the Diamond Exchange District (on the Ramat Gan side). In 2018 a northern access terminal fronting Modaii bridge opened, adding a third passenger entry and exit point out of the station and facilitating additional access to the Diamond Exchange District. An underground station of the future Red Line light rail is being built at the site to be opened by late 2022. The station is named after Menachem Savidor, Israel Railways' chairman between 1954‚Äì1964 and later the speaker of the Knesset. ==History== The original terminus before the relocation, on a map from 1958 Entrance The railway station was originally the southern terminus of the Coastal railway line, which opened on November 3, 1954 and reached what was then the northern fringe of Tel Aviv. For the next four decades, it only handled trains to and from the north, and was colloquially known as Tel Aviv North station. This colloquial name could be ambiguous because between 1949 and Tel Aviv central's opening in 1954, \\"Tel Aviv North\\" was the official name of the Bnei Brak railway station. Railway service to and from destinations south of Tel Aviv was provided from Tel Aviv South railway station, which was not connected with Tel Aviv Central. In its initial configuration as a terminal station, the passenger platforms were located directly north of the terminal building, to the west of their present location. In 1988, the tracks leading to the station (along the present Pinchas Sapir Street) were shifted eastwards as works on the Ayalon Highway and railway progressed southwards. The station's platforms were then moved to their current location and a pedestrian bridge over the Ayalon Highway was built to connect them to the terminal building to the west. The station with its relocated tracks was opened to the public on January 10, 1988, and the official opening took place on May 3 of the same year. In 1993 the station ceased being a terminal station when the Ayalon section of the coastal railway was extended to link with the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway in southern Tel Aviv. At that point, the little-used Tel Aviv South station (which unlike Tel Aviv Central was not located on the Ayalon railway) was closed for passengers and services operating to it were routed to the more conveniently-located Tel Aviv Central station instead. Between the closing of the Tel Aviv South railway station and the opening of Tel Aviv HaShalom railway station in 1996, Tel Aviv Central was the only active passenger railway station in Tel Aviv. Nowadays, Tel Aviv Central is one of four active passenger railway stations located within Tel Aviv's municipal borders.Israel Railways Lines and Stations In 2005 a third island platform serving tracks 6-7 was added to the station. Until 1980 the head office of Israel Railways was located at the Haifa Central Station when Tzvi Tzafriry, the general manager of Israel Railways decided to move the head office to Tel Aviv Central.\\"From press release of May.\\" (Press Release May 2009) (Archive) Israel Railways. Retrieved on 9 April 2013. In 2017 Israel Railways' head office was relocated from Tel Aviv Central to a new office complex situated on the grounds of the Lod railway station. Electrification works in the station began in 2019 and were completed on 5 April 2020. ==Central bus terminal== The Central Bus Terminal in 2007 The central bus terminal (◊û◊°◊ï◊£ ◊®◊õ◊ë◊™ ◊û◊®◊õ◊ñ), Arlozorov Terminal or Tel Aviv 2000 Terminal (◊û◊°◊ï◊£ 2000) is a major bus station located next to the Tel Aviv Central railway station, near the border of Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan, next to the Ayalon Highway and the junction of several traffic arteries: Jabotinsky Road that leads to Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva, Begin Road that goes to south Tel Aviv, Namir Road to north Tel Aviv and further to Highway 2 and Arlozorov street westward to the sea. Arlozorov/2000 Terminal should not be confused however with the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, located in southern Tel Aviv ‚Äì nearby the HaHagana railway station. Together, the bus and train terminals at the site constitute a major transportation hub that plays a significant role in both short- and long-distance public transportation in Israel. The Tel Aviv Light Rail will also have a station in the same area. As of 2016 the bus terminal serves about 120,000 passengers daily. Buses of Egged, Dan, Kavim, Metropoline, Afikim, Superbus and Nateev Express bus companies stop at the terminal and surrounding streets. The terminal lies in the open air, unlike the central bus stations in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and some other cities, which are inside large buildings that also double as shopping malls. The open-air central bus terminal underwent renovations in 2018-2019. ==References *Tel Aviv Savidor Central at the Israel Railways website *Transport Today and Tomorrow Category:Railway stations in Tel Aviv Category:Railway stations opened in 1954 ","title":"Tel Aviv Savidor Central railway station"},{"id":"6250773","text":"Speed skating team of the Euclid School, Brooklyn in the early 1900s. From left: Morris Wood, Allen Taylor, Hugh Palliser and Gus Stolz. Brooklyn has an active sports scene that spans over a hundred years. The borough is home of the Barclays Center and the National Basketball Association's Brooklyn Nets as well as the National Hockey League's New York Islanders, and for many decades the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball before they moved to Los Angeles in 1957. Brooklyn has also been a breeding place for many famous sports figures such as Joe Paterno (Penn State), Joe Pepitone (MLB), Joe Torre (MLB), Al \\"Bummy\\" Davis (boxing), Larry Brown (NBA), Michael Jordan (NBA), Mike Tyson (boxing), Paul Lo Duca (MLB), Vinny Testaverde (NFL), and Vince Lombardi (NFL). Parks throughout the borough including Prospect Park, Marine Park, and the community sports complex at Floyd Bennett Field provide residents an opportunity to practice and hone their sports skills and talents. ==Baseball Early baseball === Brooklyn has been a hotbed of baseball going back to the sport's infancy. A box score from October 21, 1845, lists a game between the New York Base Ball Club and \\"Brooklyn Players\\". The New York Base Ball Club was one of the first to play under rules codified by the New York Knickerbockers only one month earlier but no one knows the rules of that \\"first box score\\" game. In the mid-1850s, dozens of ballclubs were formally constituted in greater New York City. When the fraternity convened for the first time to revise playing rules, 8 Brooklyn clubs were among the 16, traditionally considered the founding members of the National Association of Base Ball Players. In summer 1858, the Fashion Race Course in Corona, Queens hosted a series of three \\"all star\\" games between New York City and Brooklyn teams. That was a milestone in commercialization, the first baseball games with admission for sale.The 1858 Fashion Race Course Baseball Match, Baseball Almanac, http://www.baseball-almanac.com/treasure/autont2006b.shtml Accessed August 5, 2013 Brooklyn teams dominated play in the NABBP during the early and mid-1860s, with the Atlantic, Excelsior, Eckford, and Atlantic clubs contending for championships in that order. (All three were among the 16 founding clubs. The Atlantics both preceded Excelsior and outlived Eckford as claimant to the very top spot.) During the War, which curtailed the game greatly, William Cammeyer opened Union Grounds in Williamsburg, the first enclosed field dedicated to baseball, which put the game on a commercial basis. (It was dedicated to baseball most of the year but flooded and used for ice sports in the winter.) The Eckfords played home games at Union Grounds and the New York Mutuals relocated there in 1868, from Hoboken, New Jersey, where several Manhattan clubs were based. A second enclosed baseball park opened, the Capitoline Grounds in Bedford-Stuyvesant, served as home to the Atlantics.Other clubs would have rented both grounds, too. Very likely the major clubs made annual arrangements including some priority in scheduling. === League baseball === The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), the first professional league was established in 1871. The three major clubs calling Brooklyn home all joined by its second season, so both grounds are in the record books if we count the NA as a major league. For 1873 the Eckfords went out of business and the Atlantics moved in as second team at the Union Grounds, sharing with the Mutuals for three seasons. The Mutuals continued as a charter member of the National League in 1876 and the Hartfords of Brooklyn played there in 1877. Brooklyn's most famous team, the Dodgers, got its start as a minor league team in 1883, joining the American Association in 1884, calling themselves the Bridegrooms and playing at the first of three venues called Washington Park. The team moved to the National League in 1890 and relocated to Ebbets Field in 1913. In the years prior to 1932, they were also known as the Superbas and the Robins, the last an informal name taken from their manager, Wilbert Robinson. The team name is short for \\"trolley dodgers\\", a reference to the many streetcar lines that once criss-crossed the borough. Perennial losers, the Dodgers were called \\"bums\\" by their fans, first with derision, eventually with affection. The Dodgers greatest achievement came in 1947 when Jackie Robinson took the field in a Dodgers uniform, the first Major League African American player of the modern era. The Brooklyn Dodgers won National League pennants in 1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953, but lost the 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952 & 1953 World Series to their longtime rival the New York Yankees. In 1955, the Dodgers won their first and only World Series in Brooklyn, beating the rival New York Yankees, resulting in mass euphoria and celebrations all over Brooklyn. Just two years later, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, after the 1957 season, causing widespread resentment and sorrow. Brooklyn's most beloved and cherished institution had left, and the move is cited by some historians as one of the catalysts for the decline of Brooklyn in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders of the Players' League in 1890 and the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League in 1914 and 1915 called the borough home. The Players' League team played in Eastern Park, in what is now known as East New York. The Tip-Tops played in the final incarnation of Washington Park. After a 43-year hiatus, baseball returned to the borough in the form of the Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor league team that began playing in Coney Island in 2001. The Cyclones are a short season Class A New York‚ÄìPenn League affiliate of the New York Mets professional team. The Cyclones play at MCU Park, located in southern Brooklyn near the Coney Island Boardwalk. During hot summer nights, fireworks are sometimes used to signify the commencement of the baseball games. ==Basketball== Barclays Center in Prospect Heights is Brooklyn's major league sports venue. On January 23, 2004, developer Bruce Ratner announced that he had purchased the National Basketball Association's Nets franchise (then known as the New Jersey Nets) and started on his plan to move the Nets to the 18,000-seat Barclays Center as part of the Atlantic Yards development at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. After years of delays caused by community opposition and financial difficulties, the arena broke ground in March 2010 and opened in September 2012. The Nets officially changed their names to the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012, and the move was made official. The Nets thus became Brooklyn's first major league sports team in 55 years. The Brooklyn Kings, a United States Basketball League team, played in Downtown Brooklyn until 2007. The borough also had a franchise in the American Basketball Association in 2006 called the Brooklyn Wonders. A new American Basketball Association team called the Brooklyn Skyrockets started in 2014 and plays at the Aviator Sports and Events Center at Floyd Bennett Field. ==Football== Several professional football teams have called Brooklyn home, including two in 1926. The Brooklyn Horsemen of the original American Football League and the Brooklyn Lions of the National Football League competed for a time before merging in November and folding at season's end. In 1930, the Brooklyn Dodgers began play at Ebbets Field. The team lasted until 1944, calling themselves the Brooklyn Tigers that last season but going winless. In 1945, the team was merged with the Boston Yanks and played one more home game in Brooklyn that season as the Yanks. The second AFL also had a Brooklyn Tigers club in 1936, but the team never played in Brooklyn and folded after only seven games. In 1946, the new All-America Football Conference had yet another Brooklyn Dodgers team. This club lasted until 1948, after which it merged with the New York Yankees football team. The renamed Brooklyn-New York Yankees folded after one season when the AAFC merged with the NFL. There was an independent minor league team called the Brooklyn Dodgers in the short- lived Continental Football League in 1966. Like the AFL Brooklyn Tigers team, they never played in Brooklyn, but were called so because baseball Dodger legend Jackie Robinson was the general manager of the team. They played their home games at Downing Stadium in Randall's Island, and then folded after one season when the team failed to draw. Finally, the Brooklyn Bolts of the Fall Experimental Footaball League played at MCU Park from 2014-2015. ==Ice hockey== Brooklyn Crescents ice hockey team in 1905‚Äì06. Brooklyn had two teams represented in the American Amateur Hockey League which operated from 1896‚Äì1917; the Brooklyn Skating Club (1896‚Äì1906) and the Brooklyn Crescents (1896‚Äì97, 1899‚Äì1917). The Brooklyn Skating Club won one championship title in 1898‚Äì99 whereas the Brooklyn Crescents captured nine championship titles between 1900‚Äì1912. Both teams had a considerable influx of Canadian players. The Brooklyn Americans, formerly known as the New York Americans, were a National Hockey League club in the 1941‚Äì42 season. Despite the name, the team played its home games at Madison Square Garden and never played a game in Brooklyn. Brooklyn has two ice rink facilities, Aviator Sports and Recreation (a twin NHL regulation ice sheet facility) in Floyd Bennett Field in Southeast Brooklyn, and Abe Stark Rink in Coney Island. The New York Aviators were a single-A minor league professional hockey team in the newly formed Federal Hockey League (FHL) which consists of six teams throughout New York State, Connecticut, and near Cornwall, Ontario. The organization changed their name to the Brooklyn Aviators before the 2011‚Äì2012 season, but folded after the season. The Aviators' home arena was the Aviator Sports and Events Center located at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York. The NHL's New York Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in 2015 after playing at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum since their inception in 1972. Also in 2015, the New York Riveters, of the National Women's Hockey League, played their inaugural season at Aviator Sports and Events Center. The following year it was announced that the Riveters would relocate to Barnabas Health Hockey House at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, thus ending their tenure in Brooklyn. ==Soccer== A minor league soccer team called Brooklyn Knights plays at the Metropolitan Oval, which is one of the oldest soccer venues in the US but is actually located in Maspeth, Queens. The team competes in the USL PDL. The New York Cosmos of the NASL began playing at MCU Park in 2017.Elstein, Aaron. \\"Renowned Cosmos soccer team faces possible extinctionThe sport's governing body has moved to relegate the team Pele once played for to a lower division\\", Crain's New York Business, September 11, 2017. Accessed September 16, 2017. \\"In 2009 the NASL was revived, and the Cosmos reappeared soon after. But few attended games at Hofstra University on Long Island, and, after piling up about $30 million in losses, the Cosmos were about to shut down again last year when Commisso rescued the team and moved it to Coney Island's MCU Park, the 7,000-seat home of the Brooklyn Cyclones minor-league baseball team.\\" ==Rugby== In Rugby league, the Brooklyn Kings represent Brooklyn in the semi professional USA Rugby League competition. In Rugby union, Rugby United New York joined Major League Rugby in 2019. They play their home games at MCU Park in Coney Island. Brooklyn Rugby Football Club is a men's team competing in Division III of the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union and Brooklyn Women's Rugby Football Club is a women's team in Division II of the same union. The Public School Athletic League now supports rugby too, and flag (non-contact) rugby is played in numerous public elementary, middle and high schools across the borough. ==Wrestling== Fans of professional wrestling have long admired Steve Lombardi, best known as The Brooklyn Brawler, as one of the sport's premier jobbers. ECW legend Tazz is also proud of his Brooklyn roots, hailing from the Red Hook area of the city. Other well-known wrestlers from Brooklyn include: * Nelson Erazo, best known as Homicide in TNA. * Brandon Silvestry, best known as Low Ki in the independent ranks, also a TNA alumnus, and was with WWE, in its Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory as Kaval. He is now on the independent scene. * Former WWE wrestlers Shad Gaspard & JTG, also known at the time was Cryme Tyme. ==See also== * Sports in New York City ==NotesReferences== *Retrosheet. \\"Park Directory\\".

Z. Hill, Denise LaSalle, Latimore, Dorothy Moore, Little Milton, Shirley Brown, Tyrone Davis, Marvin Sease, and the Mississippi Mass Choir. It has received an historic marker issued by the Mississippi Blues Commission to commemorate its important place on the Mississippi Blues Trail. A tornado on April 15, 2011, destroyed much of the company's main building and studio at 3023 West Northside Drive in Jackson, Mississippi, which have since been re-built. ==Company historyBeginnings: 1962‚Äì1975=== Malaco ( ) Inc. was founded in 1962 by Tommy Couch and Mitchell Malouf, initially as a booking agency. In 1967, the company opened a recording studio in a building that remains the home of Malaco. Experimenting with local songwriters and artists, the company began producing master recordings. Malaco needed to license their early recordings with established labels for national distribution. Between 1968 and 1970, Capitol Records released six singles and a Grammy Award-nominated album by Mississippi Fred McDowell. Revenue from record releases was minimal, however, and Malaco survived doing jingles, booking bands, promoting concerts, and renting the studio for custom projects. In May 1970, a bespectacled producer-arranger changed the struggling company's fortune. Wardell Quezergue made his mark with New Orleans stalwarts Fats Domino and Professor Longhair, among others. Quezergue offered to supply Malaco with artists in return for studio time and session musicians. Quezergue brought five artists to Jackson in a borrowed school bus for a marathon session that yielded two hits ‚Äì King Floyd's \\"Groove Me\\" and Jean Knight's \\"Mr. Big Stuff.\\" But the tracks met rejection when submitted to Stax and Atlantic Records for distribution. Frustrated, Malaco released the King Floyd tracks on its own Chimneyville label. When \\"Groove Me\\" started radio play and sales, Atlantic picked the record up for distribution after all, giving Malaco a label deal for future Chimneyville product. \\"Groove Me\\" entered the national charts in October, going to No. 1 on the US Billboard R&B; chart and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1971, Chimneyville scored again with King Floyd's \\"Baby Let Me Kiss You\\" (No. 5 R&B; and No. 29 Pop). Meanwhile, Stax decided to take a chance on \\"Mr. Big Stuff\\", selling over two million copies on the way to No. 1 on the R&B; chart and No. 2 pop. Malaco's studio and session musicians were now in demand. Drummer James Stroud, bassist Vernie Robbins and guitarist Jerry Puckett were the nucleus of the Malaco Rhythm Section. Atlantic sent the Pointer Sisters among others for the Malaco touch; Stax sent Rufus Thomas and others. In January 1973, Paul Simon recorded material for his There Goes Rhymin' Simon album. Later that year, Malaco released its first gospel record, \\"Gospel Train\\" by the Golden Nuggets on Atlantic's Cotillion label. Also in 1973, King Floyd's \\"Woman Don't Go Astray\\" made No. 5 R&B.; When Dorothy Moore recorded \\"Misty Blue\\" in 1973, Malaco got rejection slips trying to shop the master to other labels. Two years later, Malaco was just about broke and desperate for something to sell. With just enough cash to press and mail out the record, \\"Misty Blue\\" was released on the Malaco label just before Thanksgiving. ===Golden era: 1976‚Äì1985=== Dorothy Moore's \\"Misty Blue\\" earned gold records around the world, peaking at No. 2 R&B; and No. 3 pop in the US, and No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1976. This was followed by thirteen chart records. Moore got four Grammy Award nominations in her career. Other signings to the label included funk bands such as Freedom, Natural High, Power, and Sho-Nuff. Another Malaco gamble in the late 1970s was targeting the gospel market again with the Jackson Southernaires. The gamble paid off, and other premium gospel artists signed on, including the Soul Stirrers, The Sensational Nightingales, The Williams Brothers, The Truthettes, Willie Banks and the Messengers and the Angelic Gospel Singers. The Southernaires's Frank Williams became Malaco's Director of Gospel Operations, producing virtually every Malaco gospel release until his death in 1993. By 1977, songwriters, artists, and producers from the defunct Stax Records were knocking on Malaco's doors, including Eddie Floyd, Frederick Knight, The Fiestas, and David Porter. By this time, Malaco had stopped trying to compete with mainstream labels. However, Malaco could make a tidy profit selling between 25,000 and 50,000 units. Starting with Z. Z. Hill, Malaco became the center for old-time blues and soul artists. Hill released the single \\"Cheating in the Next Room\\", which reached R&B; No. 19 in 1982. Hill's album, Down Home Blues, sold over 500,000 copies, before he suddenly died in 1984. Hearing Johnnie Taylor sing at the funeral service, Tommy Couch invited Taylor to become Malaco's new flagship artist. Denise LaSalle charted fourteen times in the 1970s. After 29 chart entries for other labels, blues guitarist Little Milton signed with Malaco in 1984. Little Milton's first Malaco single \\"The Blues is Alright\\" re- established his presence as a major blues artist and solidified Malaco's reputation as the contemporary southern blues company. In 1985, Malaco signed Bobby Bland. He had notched up 62 Billboard R&B; chart records in 25 years. In 1985, the principals at Malaco, Tommy Couch, Wolf Stephenson and Stewart Madison bought Muscle Shoals Sound Studios which, by that time, was located at 1000 Alabama Avenue in Sheffield, Alabama. ===1986‚Äì2010=== Bobby Bland had a hit album, Midnight Run, on the US soul album chart in 1989. Johnnie Taylor had his final hit on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart in 1990. In 1996, the label signed the Chicago-based soul singer, Tyrone Davis to the label, almost 30 years after his first major hit \\"Can I Change My Mind\\", an R&B; No. 1. In 2005, the owners decided to sell this studio because they were having difficulty keeping the studio booked. The building was bought by a film and television production company. ==Malaco studio destroyed== On April 15, 2011, the company's Jackson studio and offices were hit by a tornado that caused major damage and destruction. Thousands of master tapes from recording sessions survived intact in a separate concrete vault. The company decided to re-build the damaged offices and recording studio on the same site and the new buildings were opened in the fall of 2012. This storm came six years after Hurricane Katrina also hit the area, causing some damage to the Malaco premises. ==Gospel== Clearly the dominant contemporary southern blues label, Malaco purchased the gospel division of Savoy Records in 1986. Now, Malaco was also the preeminent black gospel company in North America. The Savoy acquisition brought a vast catalog of recordings, including albums by Shirley Caesar, Rev. James Cleveland, Albertina Walker, The Caravans, and Inez Andrews. In further expansion moves that year, Malaco entered the world of telemarketing. Malaco's gospel labels under Jerry Mannery, and Savoy Records under Milton Biggham, earned multiple honors, including Billboard designations as Top Gospel Label and Top Gospel Distributor, while the artists received numerous awards (Grammy, Stellar, Soul Train, and Gospel Music Workshop), as well as Billboard Top Gospel Artist of the Year designations. The company also dominated Billboard Gospel charts, achieving No. 1 rankings by Keith Pringle, Walter Hawkins, Rev. James Moore, The Mississippi Mass Choir, and Dorothy Norwood. ==Malaco Music Group== Malaco's market focus widened dramatically in 1995. Songwriter/producer Rich Cason cut \\"Good Love\\" with Johnnie Taylor. In 1996, Taylor's eighth album for Malaco, Good Love!, reached number one on the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart (No. 15 R&B;), and was the most commercially successful album in Malaco's history. In 1997, Malaco was without a distribution deal and formed Malaco Music Group, which consists of Malaco Records and its subsidiaries. The company continued its steady, prudent expansion, purchasing half of the Memphis-based distributor Select-O-Hits and also making inroads into the urban contemporary, jazz, and contemporary Christian markets. Malaco Records has been designated as a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail. The company continue to release records in the 21st century. ==Labels under Malaco== *Atlanta International Records *Savoy Records *Apollo Records *Shurfine Records *Juana Records *601 Records *Onyx Records ==Artists== *Angelic Gospel Singers * Anita Ward *Blind Boys of Alabama *Bobby Bland *Bobby Rush *Bryan Andrew Wilson *The Caravans *Clara Ward & The Famous Ward Singers * Clyde Bradley Singers *The Controllers *The Davis Sisters *Denise LaSalle * Dolores Barrett & Her Sisters *Dondria *Dorothy MooreCarpenter, Bil.

A chord chart (or chart) is a form of musical notation that describes the basic harmonic and rhythmic information for a song or tune. It is the most common form of notation used by professional session musicians playing jazz or popular music. It is intended primarily for a rhythm section (usually consisting of piano, guitar, drums and bass). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to improvise the individual notes used for the chords (the \\"voicing\\") and the appropriate ornamentation, counter melody or bassline. In some chord charts, the harmony is given as a series of chord symbols above a traditional musical staff. The rhythmic information can be very specific and written using a form of traditional notation, sometimes called rhythmic notation, or it can be completely unspecified using slash notation, allowing the musician to fill the bar with chords or fills any way he or she sees fit (called \\"comping\\"). In Nashville notation the key is left unspecified on the chart by substituting numbers for chord names. This facilitates on-the-spot key changes to songs. Chord charts may also include explicit parts written in modern music notation (such as a musical riff that the song is dependent on for character), lyrics or lyric fragments, and various other information to help the musician compose and play their part. ==Rhythmic notation== Rhythmic notation specifies the exact rhythm in which to play or comp the indicated chords. The chords are written above the staff and the rhythm is indicated in the traditional manner, though pitch is unspecified through the use of slashes placed on the center line instead of notes. This is contrasted with the less specific slash notation.Konowitz, Bert (1998). Teach Yourself Chords and Progressions at the Keyboard, p.68-69. . ==Slash notation== Slash notation in 4/4 with a slash on each beat under a i7 iv7-V7 chord progression in B minor Slash notation is a form of purposefully vague musical notation which indicates or requires that an accompaniment player or players improvise their own rhythm pattern or comp according to the chord symbol given above the staff. On the staff a slash is placed on each beat (so that there are four slashes per measure in 4/4 time). Slash notation and rhythmic notation may both be used in the same piece, for example, with the more specific rhythmic notation used in a section where the horn section is playing a specific melody or rhythmic figure that the pianist must support, and with slash notation written for the pianist for use underneath improvised solos. ==Nashville notation== Nashville notation or Nashville Number SystemGorow, Ron (2002). Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today's Musician, p.251. 2nd Edition. . is a method of writing, or sketching out, musical ideas, using numbers in place of chord names. For example, in the key of C major, the chord D minor seventh can be written as \\"2‚àí7\\", \\"2m7\\", or \\"ii7\\". \\"The musicians in Nashville use the Nashville Number System almost exclusively for conveying a song's structure and arrangement in the recording studio.\\" In the key of C, C=1, D=2, E=3, and so on for all seven notes in the key. Similarly, in the key of G, G=1, A=2, B=3, and so on up to F=7. So, the chord progression \`C///F///G///C///\` in the key of C would correspond to \`1///4///5///1///\` in Nashville notation, while \`G///C///D///G///\` in the key of G would also become \`1///4///5///1///\`. This method of notation allows musicians who are familiar with basic music theory to play the same song in any key, as does Roman numeral analysis. ==Grid notation== In some European countries (France particularly), pop and jazz musicians often use so-called \\"chord grids\\" that show in a graphical way the chord progression. To illustrate, below is an example of two-part tunes, each eight bars long. Each square stands for a bar, while the \\"ùÑé\\" symbol means to stay on the same chord as the previous bar. The song structure can then be written down as a succession of the different parts. For example A-A-B-A, that would mean to play twice the \\"A\\" part, once the \\"B\\" part, and then again once the \\"A\\" part. 387x387px Squares can also be separated diagonally for bars having two chords, as in the example below: 387x387px ==Chord charts in computer files== Chord charts can be represented in a schematic way as ASCII files, where bar lines are given as pipe symbols \\"\\", chord symbols are approximated as text and beats may be indicated with a forward slash \\"/\\". In this context, the term \\"chord chart\\" is also used to describe a lyric sheet where chord symbols are placed above the appropriate syllables of the lyrics to associate the relative timing of the chord changes to the words of a song, or it may refer to the handwritten lyrics with chords handwritten above them. ==See also== *Chord notation *Chord progression *Comping *Lead sheet ==References== Category:Musical notation Category:Accompaniment Category:Chords Category:Jazz terminology ","title":"Chord chart"},{"id":"6250866","text":"Gunn W√•llgren (born Gunnel Margaret Haraldsdotter W√•llgren ; 16 November 1913 - 4 June 1983) was a Swedish actress. Considered one of Sweden's finest and also to date most appreciated actresses, W√•llgren was famous for her fragile and sensual way of acting, her warm and rich inner soulfulness, and her never failing ability of presenting an absolute presence and naturalness on stage. Her Chekhov and Ibsen character interpretations, in particular, are considered to be unsurpassed. ==Biography== Born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden's second largest town, Gunn W√•llgren played a lot of amateur theatre in local groups in her teenage years. She knew very early that she wanted to become an actress although her father; the stern company manager Harald W√•llgren, strongly disapproved: To get the theatre ideas out of her head, he even sent her overseas on a trip to Switzerland. However, the acting dreams only increased as she strolled by the coast of Lake Constance and had only gotten worse by the time she returned. Carrying a tremendous personal shyness and insecurity (which came to define and restrict her private persona all her life) she secretly applied for the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school in Stockholm (in 1934) ‚Äì and was admitted on first try, at age 21. Gunn W√•llgren, 1940s Gunn W√•llgren's first major role at the Royal Dramatic Theatre as \\"premiere actress\\" became the playful daughter Mildred in Eugene O'Neill's beautiful play Ah, Wilderness! (a very successful and long-running production) in 1936. Winning the critics' and the audience's heart in her part she received an immediate contract with the Royal Dramatic Theatre after her graduation from drama school in 1937. Even though she came to work at different theatres all her life, she always returned to the national stage. Some master performances by W√•llgren on stage include her Sorel Bliss in No√´l Coward's Hay Fever in 1937, Celia in Shakespeare's As You Like It 1938 (directed by Alf Sj√∂berg), the strong portrayal of Curley's wife in the original Swedish staging of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men in 1940, Iphigenia in Goethe's Iphigenia in Tauris 1941, her Ophelia in the classic 1942 staging of Hamlet (opposite Lars Hanson in the title role), Mary Grey/Joan of Arc in Joan of Lorraine by Maxwell Anderson in 1948, Catherine Sloper in The Heiress by Ruth and Augustus Goetz in the 1950/51 season, Indra's daughter in the Olof Molander-staging of Strindberg's A Dream Play 1955, Nina in Chekhov's The Seagull 1955, Masha in Chekhov's Three Sisters 1958, Isabella in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure 1958, Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House 1962, Gerda in Strindberg's Storm 1964, Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts 196?, the grand portrayal of Madame Liubov Andreievna Ranevskaya in The Cherry Orchard by Chekhov in 1967, Martha Brewster in Arsenic and Old Lace in 1970, the title role of Agnes in Kent Andersson's 1972 play, Lena in Fugard's Boesman and Lena 1977; and the role of Ethel Thayer in Sista sommaren (play based on the Oscar-winning film On Golden Pond, starring Katharine Hepburn in the same part) in 1981. Her film debut came with Sonja in 1943, but her break- through came with Kvinnor i f√•ngenskap the same year, where W√•llgren portrayed a young prisoner on the run. Being \\"of the theatre\\" Gunn W√•llgren filmed sporadically during her life. But whenever she turned to the big screen she was \\"The Actress\\". Ranked absolutely equivalent to Ingrid Bergman back in Sweden at the time, both in beauty and in talent (in Sweden even considered some notches higher than Bergman as an actress) she delivered electrifying performances in films such as Flickan och dj√§vulen (The Girl And The Devil) (opposite Stig J√§rrel) 1944, Var sin v√§g (Each To His Own Way) 1946, Medan porten var st√§ngd (While The Door Was Locked) 1946 (written & directed by Hasse Ekman), Kvinna utan ansikte (Woman Without A Face) 1947 (with an early script by Ingmar Bergman), Glasberget (Mountain Of Glass) 1953 (directed by Hasse Ekman) and Kl√§nningen (The Dress) 1964 (directed by Olof Molander with script by Vilgot Sj√∂man), among others. Her supporting part in Gunnel Lindblom's debating drama Sally och friheten (1981) (Sally and Freedom), about a woman dealing with the painful memories and reality of an abortion, later in life rendered her Sweden's most prestigious film award, the Guldbagge Award (the Golden Beetle), for Best Actress. She was highly praised everywhere for her warm and sober portrayal of the grandmother ‚Äì the immediate centre of the Ekdahl family - in Ingmar Bergman's colourful film Fanny och Alexander (1982). The role was to be her very last, as shortly after the shooting finished she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her condition deteriorated quickly and she died on 4 June 1983; ten months later Bergman's film was awarded with 4 Oscars, one for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Gunn W√•llgren was married to 1) Erik \\"Hampe\\" Faustman (actor and film director) 1941-49 and; 2) Per-Axel Branner (stage director) 1954-75 (his death). She had two daughters (from her marriage with Faustman); Susanne and Elaine. ==Partial filmography== On the cover of Filmjournalen, 1947 On stage: as Indra's daughter in A Dream Play by August Strindberg, The Royal Dramatic Theatre, 1955 *1943: Kvinnor i f√•ngenskap - Viola *1943: Sj√§tte skottet - Lulu *1943: Sonja - Sonja's Room-mate *1943: Ordet - Kristina *1944: Flickan och dj√§vulen - Karin *1944: Kejsarn av Portugallien (Selma Lagerl√∂f's The Emperor of Portugallia) - Klara Fina Gulleborg *1945: Brott och straff (Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment) - Sonja *1945: Resan bort - Ellen Andersson *1946: Beg√§r - Ingrid *1946: While the Door Was Locked - Marianne Sahlen *1946: Harald Handfaste - Peasant woman (uncredited) *1947: Woman Without A Face - Rut K√∂hler *1948: Each to His Own Way - Birgit Sundell *1951: The Nuthouse *1953: Glasberget - Otti Moreus *1964: Kl√§nningen (aka The Dress) - Helen F√ºrst *1966: Asmodeus (TV Movie) - Madame de Berthas *1966: Kvinnas man (TV Movie) - Lotta Friman *1966: Tartuffe (TV Movie) - Elmire *1967: Fadren (aka Strindberg's The Father) (TV Movie) - Laura *1967: Geng√•ngare (aka Ibsen's Ghosts) (TV Movie) - Candida *1969: Miss and Mrs Sweden - Rose Persson-Silvergr√• *1970: Frida och hennes v√§n (TV Mini-Series) - Fridas mor *1970: S√∂derk√•kar (TV Mini-Series) - Hanna Johnsson *1972: The Man Who Quit Smoking - Aunt Gunhild *1974: Rulle p√• Rulser√∂d (TV Series) - Farmor *1976: F√∂rvandlingen (aka Kafka's The Metamorphosis) - Gregor's Mother *1977: The Brothers Lionheart - Sofia *1978: Strandvaskeren (TV Series) - Grandmother *1981: Sally and Freedom - Sally's Mother *1982: Fanny and Alexander - Helena Ekdahl - Ekdahlska huse ==Awards== *The Eugene O'Neill Award (1959) *The Swedish Theatre Critics' Award (1962) *The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (1981) ==See also== *The Gunn W√•llgren Award ==References Further reading == * ==External links== * * *Complete list of Gunn W√•llgren's stage work at the Royal Dramatic Theatre Category:1913 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Swedish actresses Category:Deaths from cancer in Sweden Category:Eugene O'Neill Award winners Category:Litteris et Artibus recipients Category:Best Actress Guldbagge Award winners Category:20th-century Swedish actresses ","title":"Gunn W√•llgren"},{"id":"6250868","text":"Gail Gregg is an American artist, photographer, and journalist, based in New York City.Karabenick, Julie (July 2006). \\"An Interview with Artist Gail Gregg\\", Geoform.

He is best known for his study of acute appendicitis and his description of Dieulafoy's lesion, a rare cause of gastric bleeding. ==Life, studies, and career== Dieulafoy was born in Toulouse. He studied medicine in Paris and earned his doctorate in 1869. Dieulafoy later became Chief of Medicine at the famed H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris, taught pathology in the University of Paris, and was elected president of the French Academy of Medicine in 1910. He died in Paris on 16 August 1911. ==Contributions== He perfected a pump-like device for use in thoracentesis, and extensively studied pleurisy and liver conditions including hydatid disease and epidemic hepatitis. However, he is perhaps best known for his study of appendicitis. Dieulafoy described its early symptoms and clinical manifestations in detail, most notably the collection of symptoms now known as Dieulafoy's triad (more below), and was one of the first physicians to stress the importance of surgery in the treatment of this condition. He declared: \\"Le traitement m√©dical de l'appendicite aigu√´ n'existe pas (The medical treatment of acute appendicitis does not exist)\\". His Handbook of Internal Pathology, published from 1880 to 1884, was widely used at the time. Between 1899 and 1910 he also published, in several volumes, the case reports from his private practice. In 1890, Dieulafoy, Andr√© Chantemesse and Georges-Fernand Widal described a pulmonary condition found in persons who habitually fed pigeons in the streets.

It stands at the western end of the Grisedale Pike- Hopegill Head ridge overlooking Crummock Water. ==Topography== The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Whiteside. The high ground in this group of fells is formed by a series of ridges in the form of the letter 'H' lying on one side. The northern ridge is formed by Whiteside, Hopegill Head and Grisedale Pike, while the Grasmoor to Causey Pike ridge runs parallel to the south. The bridge between the two is the pass of Coledale Hause. This stands at the head of two valleys, Coledale descending eastward and Gasgale Gill flowing west. Whiteside forms a shallow crescent, concave to the south and fringed on that face by the great wall of Gasgale Crags. These drop 500 ft direct from the summit ridge into the valley below. The eastern end of the fell connects to Hopegill Head without any great loss of height, while the western end of the ridge descends steeply over Whiteside End to the Vale of Lorton. The subsidiary top of Whin Ben (1,355 ft) stands at the south west corner, overlooking the point where Gasgale Gill debouches into the fields of Lanthwaite. The northern slopes are much more extensive with two long ridges being thrown out from the main mass of the fell. The shorter is Penn, while further to the east is Dodd (1,489 ft). The valley of Hopegill separates Dodd from Ladyside Pike and the northern ridge of Hopegill Head. ==Geology== The southern crags expose rock of the Kirkstile Formation, comprising laminated mudstone and siltstone. To the north is the Loweswater Formation of greywacke sandstone. In the vicinity of Dodd the Hopebeck Formation is exposed, mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone turbidities. There is also a minor intrusion of lamprophyre in this area.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There are two mining trials on the western slopes of Whiteside. On the northern side of Gasgale Gill there is a short level, perhaps aimed at picking up the course of the Force Crag vein from Coledale (see Force Crag mine). Beneath Whiteside End is a small working where some galena was extracted.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) ==Summits== Whiteside has three summits: the \\"Wainwright\\" top stands at the Crummock Water end of the ridge and has a height of 707 metres (2,320 feet). Wainwright accepted that it was not the highest point, but chose it as the summit in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. This western top does have sufficient prominence to be classified as a Nuttall. Wainwright described the true summit as the Whitesite East top, this being 400 metres further along the ridge to Hopegill Head and substantially higher at 719 metres (2,359 feet). The Nuttalls describe the true summit as \\"Whiteside East Top\\" and the lower \\"Wainwright\\" summit as \\"Whiteside\\". The third top lies further to the east, a similar distance beyond the true summit. This has a height of 703 m (2,306 ft) and is referred to in some guidebooks as Gasgill Crags.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): There is a fine vista of West Cumberland, the Solway Firth and the hills of Scotland. Closer at hand the view of the fells is interrupted by Grasmoor and Crag Hill to the south and Hopegill Head to the east, although isolated groups of fells appear in the gaps. Crummock Water and Loweswater are brought into view by descending a little to the west. The ridge walk between Whiteside and Hopegill Head is ranked as one of the best in the district with Alfred Wainwright describing it as ‚Äúan exhilarating high level traverse‚Äù; there are excellent views down into Gasgale Gill on the southern side.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): ==Ascents== The main route of ascent is from Lanthwaite Green at the north end of Crummock Water ascending heathery slopes over the minor top of Whin Ben before reaching the summit. Whiteside can also be climbed from the north, using either the Dodd or Penn ridges. ==References== Looking down into Gasgale Gill from the ridge between Whiteside and Hopegill Head Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Whiteside (Lake District)"},{"id":"6250883","text":"Elizabeth Parker (December 19, 1856 ‚Äì October 26, 1944) was a Canadian journalist in the early 1900s. She attended school in Truro, Nova Scotia, obtained her teaching certificate, married Henry John Parker at the age of 18, moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then to Winnipeg, Manitoba. She co-founded the Alpine Club of Canada in 1906 with Arthur Oliver Wheeler. In 1902, she was working at the Manitoba Free Press (now the Winnipeg Free Press), when American Alpine Club president, Charles Fay, proposed to establish a Canadian chapter of the American club. Amidst nationalistic ideals, she wrote scathing criticism of the idea, and instead helped to establish the Alpine Club of Canada as an independent Canadian mountaineering organization. She and the Manitoba Free Press continued to publicize and support Canadian mountaineering, and with the help of the Canadian Pacific Railway, she organized the founding meeting of the ACC in 1906, at which she became the Club's first secretary. Although she was not herself a mountaineer, Parker participated in many of the ACC camp trips and was at home in the mountains and among the climbing community. She helped lay out the philosophical foundations of the club in the opening article of the first Canadian Alpine Journal (1907): she saw the club as a protector of the environment, \\"a national trust for the defense of our mountain solitudes against the intrusion of steam and electricity and all the vandalisms of this luxurious utilitarian age; for the keeping free from the grind of commerce, the wooded passes and valleys and alplands of the wilderness. It is the people's right to have primitive access to the remote places of safest retreat from the fever and the fret of the market place and the beaten tracks of life.\\" She envisioned the group promoting scientific study and cultivating mountain art. It was Parker's fondest dream that mountaineering would promote conservation, patriotism, and moral discipline among Canadians. In 2006, the Canadian government (through Parks Canada) produced a dramatic presentation called \\"Elizabeth Parker and the Alpine Club of Canada\\" (written and performed by actor and Parks interpreter Laurie Schwartz) describing Parker's contribution to Canadian mountaineering. The play credits Parker not only with her contributions to Canadian mountaineering, but also \\"a feminist commitment [that] paved the way for others\\". The Alpine Club of Canada maintains the Elizabeth Parker hut near Lake O'Hara, named in her honour. Parker Ridge, overlooking Saskatchewan Glacier in Banff National Park, was named after Elizabeth Parker. ==References== Category:1856 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Canadian women journalists Category:Canadian feminists Category:Female climbers Category:Journalists from Nova Scotia Category:People from Colchester County Category:20th-century Canadian journalists Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers ","title":"Elizabeth Parker (journalist)"},{"id":"6250906","text":"is a Japanese manga artist whose works draw on Old Norse literature and other subjects from Northern Europe. ==Biography and career== In high school, start drawing manga seriously.

Clark upstaged King, passing him on the wicket-taking tally with a pair of five wicket hauls in the final 110-run win over Surrey where King got six wickets. King averaged four runs less per wicket, however, and also contributed with 614 runs, the third-most in the team.

He is sentenced to spend one lifetime in the form of dog, a native animal; if he can recover the Zoi within that dog's lifetime, he will be allowed to return to his former status as Sirius. If he does not, he will simply die at the end of his dog's life. Sirius is born into a litter of puppies. Discovered as mongrels, the puppies are thrown into the river in a sack. Kathleen O'Brien, rescues a filthy, wet, dying Sirius, and names him Leo. Kathleen lives with the Duffields, a family of four, because her father is in prison. Mr. Duffield, who can be kind as long as it's no trouble to him; the mother Daphne (\\"Duffie\\"), who makes pottery and bullies Kathleen because she's Irish; Basil, who doesn't actively dislike Kathleen but often mimics his mothers behavior and is also obsessed with \\"meteorite\\"; and Robin, who is kind but afraid of the other family members. There are also three cats (Tibbles, and her twin sons Remus and Romulus), who grudgingly befriend Sirius. Sirius is aided by Sol to find the Zoi. He sets out to explore the town, finding people to feed him when he goes hungry on Kathleen's limited allowance, including Miss Smith, a kind retired teacher, other dogs, the cold dogs, and fleas, which spreads to the cats. Although he doesn't realize it, some of the dogs (Patchie, Rover, Redears, and Bruce) are his siblings. One day, he meets Yeff, a cold dog, who has strange, feathery legs, yellow eyes, and is the only one besides Patchie and Sirius to hear the calls of the Master. He runs off after telling Sirius that \\"only those who runs with [the cold dogs] and share [their] duties are allowed to know\\" about the Master. One day, Sirius unknowingly stumbles upon Mrs. Partridge, who tried to drown him, and Bess, his mother. He flees when his former Companion appears, a friend of Mrs. Partridge's. With the help of Earth while Sol distracts his Companion, he escapes. He notes that although his Companion is beautiful, she does not compare to the meadow of flowers. His former Companion and the chief witness in his trial, a luminary from Castor, who now inhabits his sphere, find and try to kill Sirius, but they're reckless and unable to properly handle the Zoi and almost kill Tibbles with it. He meets and is helped by Moon, who informs him that the cold dogs run when she is full. When Kathleen is informed that her father was shot and killed upon trying to flee the prison he was in, she comes home early from school and flies into a rage, gleefully destroying Duffie's pottery. Duffie threatens to have Sirius put to sleep and Kathleen pretends to agree to get them out of the house, and Sirius leads Kathleen to Miss Smith. He finds Bruce, who has picked the lock on his fence. Basil follows Robin to Miss Smith's. The three find Patchie and Rover and Redears, and run with the cold and the five warm dogs into nothingness. The eight meet the Master, and they are allowed to ask for one thing each. Robin gets a puppy, and Kathleen asks to be able to understand her dog, which does not work as Sirius is not technically a dog. Basil asks for the \\"meteorite\\". To Basil and Sirius's horror, he hands the Zoi to Kathleen, who gets rid of the Companion and New-Sirius when they appear to kill Sirius, then the Master. Sirius realizes that his Companion was the one who killed the luminary he was accused of murdering, but framed Sirius, using his anger against him. She had always hated him, but he had loved her so much he made excuses for her. He manages to get it from her, turns into his luminary self, and finds that Leo's dead, Sirius having been the life/soul. He reluctantly returns to his sphere, leaving Kathleen behind. Restored to his previous position as a luminary, Sirius and Sol guide Kathleen to Patchie's puppies, where she carefully picks out a female for Miss Smith. Sirius refuses to find a replacement Companion for the sphere that circles him. Many references are made to mythology, particularly Welsh mythology in the appearance and actions of the dogs (see C≈µn Annwn) and several later characters such as Arawn. The events of this book are set in what seem to be during the Irish War of Independence, although it is never specified. Kathleen's father is a war criminal, and she was sent to the Duffields for her protection without Duffy's permission, which is why Duffy hates her so much. Kathleen speaks with an accent, and she's bullied for being Irish. For example, a group of boys follow her home after school every day and make derogatory jokes, leading to Sirius scaring them. She also gets letters and sometimes money from her father in prison, and his very last one told her he'd see her soon. This worries Sirius, because he knew they'd have to move, but the Zoi was near them, until he is shot and killed trying to escape. ==Reception and Reviews== SF writer Orson Scott Card, reviewing several DWJ reissues in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, wrote: > Yet even with a dog hero, Jones does not overload us with cute animals. > Instead they are dangerous and, by and large, rather stupid. Of course, so > are the humans, so the struggle between human and animal isn't entirely one- > sided. Dogsbody has become, deservedly, a classic, not despite but because > of its completely nontraditional cosmology. Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"Jones sees clearly and writes effectively and the girl- and-dog story is a sure, and never sticky, heart-tugger.

During his reign, he was constantly at war with the Lombards and he allowed Gaeta, his vassal, to move towards independence under its own consuls. In September 834, Andrew overthrew his son-in-law, Duke Leo, who had only been in power for six months. He immediately ceased paying the tribute to Prince Sicard of Benevento. In response, Sicard besieged Naples from May through July in 835, but reached a peace with the duke. In 836, he besieged Naples again despite their pact. Andrew garnered the ignominy of being the first to call in Saracen mercenaries to the Italian peninsula. The consequences of such an action were far- reaching. He signed the Pactum Sicardi with Sicard and the duchies of Amalfi and Sorrento on 4 July. It was supposed to be a five-year armistice during which merchants of the various coastal Greek cities were free to travel unmolested through the Principality of Benevento. However, the war continued, especially between Andrew and Sicard. In a war of 837, Andrew called in the Saracens again. Between July and August 839, Sicard died and Andrew, ever fearful of warring Lombards, called on the aid of Lothair I, King of Italy, who sent one Contardus to Naples. Fearful of Contardus, Andrew promised him his daughter Eupraxia, the widow of Leo, in marriage. Andrew, however, put off the marriage until, in March 840, Contardus rose against him and had him killed, usurping his place as he had done to Leo. ==Sources== *Ghisalberti, Alberto M.

He exhibited widely throughout Europe during his life and is known for his eclectic and prolific oeuvre which encompasses painting, sculpture, and installation. ==Life and career== Michael Buthe was born on 1 August 1944 in Sonthofen in southern Germany to a Roman Catholic family. From 1964 to 1968, he studied at the Werkkunstschule, Kassel, now the Kunsthochschule Kassel. Thereafter he studied at Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf as master student of Joseph Beuys. He began exhibiting in 1968, participating in Harald Szeeman‚Äôs landmark exhibition When Attitude Becomes Form: Live in Your Head at the Kunsthalle Bern the year after. Some of his most notable works during this time consisted of paintings made by cutting into the fabric and exposing the stretcher bars. In the 1970s, Buthe began to travel extensively to Africa and the Middle East, most notably to Morocco where he took up extended residences in the cities of Essaouira and Marrakesh. His foreign stays heavily influenced his work, incorporating the sights and sounds of the countries he visited into his visual language. The experiences likewise spurned on engagements with spiritual and mythological elements in Buthes‚Äô work. Buthe likewise began to create installation works from the 1970s onward. In 1972, he attempted to bring Gnawa musicians to documenta 5, envisioning them performing in traditional tents. Given their minority status in Morocco‚Äîtherefore lacking Moroccan passports‚Äîthe musicians were barred from performing internationally. Though he was unable to fully realize this project, Buthe was galvanized to further develop his immersive, large-scale works. Buthe was also a professor at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf from 1983 until his death at the age of 50 in 1994. Amongst others, Klaus Girnus and Stefan K√ºrten were two of his master students. Despite enjoying success throughout Europe, he was relatively under-discussed amongst his contemporaries in America, but has come under recent re-examination with a number of posthumous solo and group exhibitions. His work was well collected by museums both during his lifetime and in recent years. Significant representations of his work can be found in S.M.A.K - Stedelijk Museum voor Actguele Kunst, Ghent; Tate Britain, London; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and Kolumba, the Art Museum of the Archdiocese of Cologne. ==Selected exhibitions Selected solo exhibitions === * 2016: Michael Buthe and Ingvild Goetz - A friendship, Sammlung Goetz, Munich * 2015-16: Michael Buthe, Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland; S.M.A.K. - Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent; Haus der Kunst, Munich * 2013: Secrets, Alexander and Bonin, New York * 2009: Michael Buthe: The Angel and His Shadow, Arp-Museum Banhof, Rolandseck * 1999: Michael Buthe: Fr√ºhe Zeichnungen, Collagen und Tageb√ºcher, Kunsthalle Bielefeld * 1989: Primavera Pompeijana, W√ºrttembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart * 1985: Michel de la Sainte Beaut√©, Galerie Moderne Kunst Dietmar Werle, Cologne * 1980: Die endlose Reise der Bilder, Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany * 1975: Colonia, Agrippinensis, Babylonia, Africanus, Dei, Galerie Abis, Berlin * 1973: Le Dieux de Babylon, K√∂lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne; Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland * 1971: Hommage an die Sonne, Galerie Toni Gerber, Bern, Switzerland === Selected group exhibitions === * 2014-15: Playing by heart, Kolumba, Cologne * 2012: La Triennale \\"Intense Proximity‚Äù, Palais de Tokyo and other venues, Paris * 2001: 70er Jahre, Kunstmusem Luzern, Switzerland * 1995: Auf Papier, Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt * 1989: Refigured Painting ‚Äì The German Image, Solomon R.

It lies to the east of Crummock Water and south of Crag Hill. From the summit there are excellent panoramas of the Sca Fell and High Stile ranges. ==Topography== The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Wandope. The highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east-west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike. Grasmoor has the greatest elevation, but Crag Hill stands at the hub of the range. It sends out a subsidiary ridge to the south west, stepping down over Wandope and Whiteless Pike toward Buttermere village. Wandope is not prominent in views from below and from most directions appears subservient to its higher neighbours. The connection to Crag Hill is the broad plateau of Wandope Moss, sloping down easily to the west. On the opposite side is the striking feature of Addacomb Hole. This symmetrical hanging valley resembles a half crater, its headwall being 700 ft high. The ridge south westward from Wandope is divided into two by Third Gill. The eastern branch is a short blunt ended spur, but the western arm narrows to the fine airy ridge of Whiteless Edge. This makes straight for the summit of Whiteless Pike across the col of Saddle Gate (2,065 ft). The flanks of the ridge are steep and rough throughout, but with more exposed rock to the east. All of the run-off from the fell finds its way ultimately to Crummock Water, the Derwent-Cocker watershed ignoring Wandope in favour of the onward connection from Crag Hill to Ard Crags. Sail Beck carries the water from the south and east, running out from between Knott Rigg and Whiteless Pike into Buttermere village. Addacomb Beck and Third Gill are the tributaries which mark the northern and southern boundaries of Wandope on this flank. To the north and west of the fell is Rannerdale Beck, disgorging its flow direct into the centre section of the lake. ==Geology== The summit areas of Wandope are composed of the Ordovician Kirkstile Formation. This is the typical rock of the Skiddaw fells and is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone. Beneath this are the Greywacke sandstone turbidites of the Loweswater Formation. The Causey Pike Fault runs across the southern flanks of the fell, beyond which are the rocks of the Buttermere Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) ==Summit== A small cairn marks the summit on a gentle grassy dome, a few yards in from the fall into Addacomb Hole. The view north is blocked by Grasmoor and Crag Hill, but a glorious mountain view extends in all other directions. The Scafells are perhaps the highlight from this vantage point. ==Ascents== Buttermere is the obvious starting point for climbing Wandope, and several routes are available. Sail Beck and then Third Gill can be followed to give a toehold on the shorter eastern branch of the south west ridge. Alternatively Sail Beck can be followed further up the valley until Addacomb Beck is reached. Above this point a fine ridge can be seen, skirting the southern rim of Addacomb Hole. Indirect routes are also popular, and Wandope can either be added to the traverse of the Grasmoor-Causey Pike ridge, or taken on a circuit of Rannerdale.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==References== Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Wandope"},{"id":"6250959","text":"Yuan Xun (ÂÖÉÊÅÇ) (483‚Äì497), n√© Tuoba Xun (ÊãìÊãîÊÅÇ, changed 496), courtesy name originally Yuandao (ÂÖÉÈÅì), then Xuandao (ÂÆ£ÈÅì, changed 496), was a crown prince of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. Tuoba Xun was born in 483, as Emperor Xiaowen's oldest son. His mother was Consort Lin. At the time he was born, Emperor Xiaowen's step-grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Feng was the regent, and she opined that, pursuant to Northern Wei's tradition that a crown prince's mother should be forced to commit suicide, Consort Lin, because Tuoba Xun would presumably eventually become crown prince, should be forced to commit suicide. Even though Emperor Xiaowen did not want to follow that tradition, he did not want to disobey Grand Empress Dowager Feng, and Consort Lin was forced to commit suicide. He did, however, posthumously honor her as Empress Zhen, and buried her at the ancestral tomb of the emperors. Grand Empress Dowager Feng raised Tuoba Xun herself. In 486, when he was three, she formally named him Xun, and also gave him the courtesy name Yuandao. She died in 490, and it is not clear who raised him after that point. In 493, Emperor Xiaowen created him crown prince. In 494, when Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital from Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi) to Luoyang as a major part of sinicization campaign, Tuoba Xun accompanied his father south. In 496, when Emperor Xiaowen changed the imperial clan's family name from Tuoba to Yuan, the crown prince's courtesy name was changed from Yuandao to Xuandao. Yuan Xun was described as obese and uninterested in studies, but liked horseriding. Because he could not endure Luoyang's much warmer weather, he often wanted to return to Pingcheng, but did not get a chance to do so until 495, when Emperor Xiaowen sent him to Pingcheng to mourn Grand Empress Dowager Feng's brother Feng Xi (È¶ÆÁÜô), who was in charge of the old capital. From this point on, whenever Emperor Xiaowen conducted campaigns against rival Southern Qi, Yuan Xun would often be formally in charge of the capital, although high- level officials were actually responsible for important matters. It was also around this time that Emperor Xiaowen considered having him marry Feng Xi's granddaughter as his wife, but because she was young, Emperor Xiaowen took for Yuan Xun two concubines first‚ÄîConsorts Liu and Zheng, both daughters of his officials. However, on advice of Yuan Xun's teachers, who believed that overly engaging in sexual relations would stunt the crown prince's growth and interfere with his studies, Emperor Xiaowen did not permit him to have sexual intercourse with them during the day. (The implication of the passage in question from the Book of Wei appears to suggest that he did not have sexual relations with them at all, but it is not clear; in any case, neither had children.) In fall 496, while Emperor Xiaowen was away from the capital, Yuan Xun, unable to endure the heat in Luoyang, made an impulsive decision to seize horses and flee with his attendants to Pingcheng. His assistant Gao Daoyue (È´òÈÅìÊÇÖ) tried to persuade him not to carry out this action, and Yuan Xun killed him. However, the news leaked, and the general Yuan Yan (ÂÖÉÂÑº) closed the city gates and prevented the crown prince from leaving. Once Emperor Xiaowen returned to the capital, he, along with his brother Yuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁ¶ß) the Prince of Xianyang, caned Yuan Xun more than 100 times, and then imprisoned him. About one and a half months later, Emperor Xiaowen deposed Yuan Xun and demoted him to commoner rank, changed his courtesy name to Xuandao and put him under house arrest with minimal supplies. In spring 497, Emperor Xiaowen created Yuan Xun's oldest younger brother Yuan Ke as crown prince, to replace him. Once deposed, Yuan Xun much regretted his actions. However, the official Li Biao (ÊùéÂΩ™), in charge of guarding him, then made a false report to Emperor Xiaowen that Yuan Xun was still plotting with his attendants.

He has played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with both the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and New York Islanders. Gillies was primarily used as an enforcer, as evidenced by his career NHL statistics of 57 games with only three points and 261 penalty minutes. ==Playing career== Undrafted, Gillies played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. In 1999‚Äì2000 Gillies made his professional debut with the Mississippi Sea Wolves in the East Coast Hockey League. With limited offensive ability Gillies plied his trade between the ECHL and American Hockey League (AHL) for five years before signing an NHL contract with the New York Rangers on July 20, 2004. Prior to the 2005‚Äì06 season and in his second year with the Rangers affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, Gillies was traded from the Rangers to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for Steve Rucchin on August 5, 2005. He was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates, and played in one NHL game for the Ducks, recording 21 penalty minutes in 2 minutes, 40 seconds of ice time. On July 2, 2007, Gillies was signed by the Carolina Hurricanes to a one-year contract. Gillies never played a regular season game with the Hurricanes, as he was assigned to the Albany River Rats. On September 14, 2009, Gillies signed with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the AHL for the 2009‚Äì10 season. After 18 games with the Tigers and accumulating 123 penalty minutes, Gillies was signed by NHL affiliate, the New York Islanders on January 28, 2010. On March 14, 2010, Gillies scored his first NHL point, when he assisted on a Tim Jackman goal in a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Gillies re-signed with the Islanders on a one-year contract through to the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season on April 15, 2010. On February 12, 2011, Gillies was suspended nine games by the NHL for an incident which occurred in a February 11, 2011 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. During the third period of the game, Gillies elbowed Penguins' forward Eric Tangradi in the face, punched him several times while he was down on the ice, and proceeded to taunt him from the dressing room hallway. Tangradi suffered concussion like symptoms and remained out of the Penguins line-up indefinitely. In his first game back from the suspension, Gillies was ejected for a hit on Cal Clutterbuck in a game against the Minnesota Wild on March 2, 2011. After an in-person hearing, Gillies was suspended for 10 games for the incident.Source: New York Islanders' Trevor Gillies to meet with NHL to discuss hit - ESPN New York After playing in only three games to start the 2011‚Äì12 season Gillies was placed on waivers on October 31, 2011. On June 19, 2012, Gillies opted to forgo North American free agency and signed a one-year contract to play with Vityaz Chekhov of the Russian Kontinental Hockey League. On August 28, 2013, Gillies signed a contract with Helsinki IFK in the Finnish SM-Liiga for the 2013‚Äì14 season.Former NHL Goon Trevor Gillies Joins HIFK - The Hockey House On November 4, 2013, Helsinki IFK terminated the contract with Gillies. During his time on HIFK he played three Finnish Liiga matches and four European Trophy matches. On October 10, 2014, after signing with the Adirondack Flames, Gillies slammed the face of Rochester Americans' William Carrier into the ice, receiving a 12-game suspension. On September 18, 2015, Gillies continued his career by signing a one-year ECHL contract with the South Carolina Stingrays. On August 28, 2018, Gillies announced his retirement from professional hockey. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

The highest-ranked countries are bright green; the lowest are brown. The Happy Planet Index (HPI) is an index of human well-being and environmental impact that was introduced by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) in July 2006. The index is weighted to give progressively higher scores to nations with lower ecological footprints. The index is designed to challenge well- established indices of countries‚Äô development, such as the gross domestic product (GDP) and the Human Development Index (HDI), which are seen as not taking sustainability into account. In particular, GDP is seen as inappropriate, as the usual ultimate aim of most people is not to be rich, but to be happy and healthy. Furthermore, it is believed that the notion of sustainable development requires a measure of the environmental costs of pursuing those goals. Out of the 178 countries surveyed in 2006, the best scoring countries were Vanuatu, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, and Panama.Marks, N., Abdallah, S., Simms, A., Thompson, S. et al. (2006). The Happy Planet Index 1.0. New Economics Foundation. In 2009, Costa Rica was the best scoring country among the 143 analyzed, followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe were featured at the bottom of the list.Abdallah, S., Thompson, S., Michaelson, J., Marks, N., Steuer, N. et al. (2009). The Happy Planet Index 2.0 . New Economics Foundation. For the 2012 ranking, 151 countries were compared, and the best scoring country for the second time in a row was Costa Rica, followed by Vietnam, Colombia, Belize and El Salvador. The lowest ranking countries in 2012 were Botswana, Chad and Qatar. In 2016, out of 140 countries, Costa Rica topped the index for the third time in a row. It was followed by Mexico, Colombia, Vanuatu and Vietnam. At the bottom were Chad, Luxembourg and Togo. ==Methodology== The HPI is based on general utilitarian principles that most people want to live long and fulfilling lives, and the country which is doing the best is the one that allows its citizens to do so, whilst avoiding infringing on the opportunity of future people and people in other countries to do the same. In effect it operationalises the IUCN's (World Conservation Union) call for a metric capable of measuring 'the production of human well- being (not necessarily material goods) per unit of extraction of or imposition upon nature'.Adams WM (2006). The future of sustainability: Re-thinking environment and development in the twenty-first century. Report of the IUCN Renowned Thinkers Meeting. Also, Paehlke R (2005). Sustainability as a bridging concept. Conservation Biology 19:36-8. The IUCN is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. And everything else remains the same. It measures what matters, a sustainable well being for all. Human well-being is conceptualized as happy life expectancy.Veenhoven R (1996). Happy life expectancy: a comprehensive measure of quality-of-life in nations. Social Indicators Research 39:1-58. Extraction of or imposition upon nature is evaluated by using the ecological footprint per capita, which attempts to estimate the amount of natural resources required to sustain a given country's lifestyle. A country with a large per capita ecological footprint uses more than its fair share of resources, both by drawing resources from other countries, and also by causing permanent damage to the planet which will affect future generations.Ecological Footprint - Ecological Sustainability. Global Footprint Network. As such, the HPI is not a measure of which are the happiest countries in the world. Countries with relatively high levels of life satisfaction, as measured in surveys, are found from the very top (Colombia in 3rd place) to the very bottom (the US in 108th place) of the rank order. The HPI is best conceived as a measure of the environmental efficiency of supporting well-being in a given country. Such efficiency could emerge in a country with a medium environmental impact (e.g. Costa Rica) and very high well-being, but it could also emerge in a country with only mediocre well- being, but very minimal environmental impact (e.g. Vietnam). Each country's HPI value is a function of its average subjective life satisfaction, life expectancy at birth, and ecological footprint per capita. The exact function is a little more complex, but conceptually it approximates multiplying life satisfaction and life expectancy, and dividing that by the ecological footprint. ==Criticism== Much criticism of the index has been due to commentators incorrectly understanding it to be a measure of personal happiness, when it is in fact a measure of the \\"happiness\\" of the planet. In other words, it is a measure of the ecological efficiency at supporting well- being.Heavy Lifting - thoughts and web finds by an economist. Heavy Lifting. July 12, 2006Who‚Äôs happiest: Denmark or Vanuatu?. Spiked. August 7, 2006 Aside from that, criticism has focused on the following: * The World Values Survey covers only a minority of the world's nations and is only carried out every five years. As a result, much of the data for the index must come from other sources or is estimated using regressions. * The subjective measures of well- being are suspect.Johns H & Ormerod P (2007). Happiness, Economics and Public Policy. London: The Institute of Economic Affairs * The ecological footprint is a controversial and much-criticized concept.The Economist. September 19, 2002. \\"Treading Lightly\\". The index has been criticized for weighting the carbon footprint too heavily, to the point that the US would have had to be universally happy and would have had to have a life expectancy of 439 years to equal Vanuatu's score in the 2006 index. Nevertheless, the HPI and its components have been considered in political circles. The ecological footprint, championed by the WWF, is widely used by both local and national governments, as well as supranational organisations such as the European Commission. The HPI itself was cited in 2007, in the British Conservative Party as a possible substitute for GDP.Cameron to offer green tax cuts. The Sunday Times. September 9, 2007. A 2007 review of progress indicators produced by the European ParliamentGoossens Y, et al. (2007). Alternative progress indicators to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a means towards sustainable development. IP/A/ENVI/ST/2007-10. Study provided for the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. lists the following pros and cons to using the HPI as a measure of national progress: ; Pros * considers the actual ‚Äòends‚Äô of economic activity in the form of life satisfaction and longevity * combines well being and environmental aspects * simple and easily understandable scheme for calculating the index * comparability of results (‚ÄòEF‚Äô and ‚Äòlife expectancy‚Äô can be applied to different countries) * data online available, although some data gaps remain * mixture of ‚Äòsoft‚Äô and ‚Äòhard‚Äô criteria; takes into account people's well-being and resource use of countries ; Cons * ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô or ‚Äòlife satisfaction‚Äô are very subjective and personal: cultural influences and complex impact of policies on happiness. * confusion of name: index is not a measure of happiness but rather a measure of environmental efficiency of supporting well-being in a given country. ==International rankings2012 ranking=== For the 2012 ranking, 151 countries were compared and nine out of the ten top countries were located in the Caribbean Basin, despite high levels of poverty. The ranking was led by Costa Rica for the second time in a row, with its lead considered to be due to its very high life expectancy which is second highest in the Americas, and higher than the US. Citizens of Costa Rica were found to experience well-being higher than many richer nations and the country had a per capita footprint one third the size of the US. The second happiest country was Vietnam. Among the top 40 countries by overall HPI score, only four countries have a GDP per capita of over . The highest ranking OECD country is Israel in 15th place, and the top Western European nation is Norway in 29th place, just behind New Zealand in 28th. Among the top five world's biggest economies in terms of GDP, Japan has the highest ranking in 45th place, followed by Germany in 46th, France is placed 50th, China 60, and the US is ranked 105, mainly due to its very high environmental footprint, the seventh highest of all countries rated for the 2012 index. ==See also== ; Indices * Bhutan GNH Index * Broad measures of economic progress * Disability- adjusted life year * Economics * Full cost accounting * Green national product * Green gross domestic product (Green GDP) * Gender-related Development Index * Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) * Global Peace Index * Gross National Happiness * Gross National Well-being (GNW) * Happiness economics * Human Development Index (HDI) * Humanistic economics * ISEW (Index of sustainable economic welfare) * Progress (history) * Progressive utilization theory * Legatum Prosperity Index * Leisure satisfaction * Living Planet Index * Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) * Money-rich, time-poor * OECD Better Life Index BLI * Post-materialism * Psychometrics * Subjective life satisfaction * Where-to-be-born Index * Wikiprogress * World Happiness Report (WHR) * World Values Survey (WVS) ==Notes * The Happy Planet Index * Official website of the New Economics Foundation Category:Happiness indices Category:Sustainability metrics and indices ","title":"Happy Planet Index"},{"id":"6251015","text":"The Ligue F√©minine de Basketball (LFB; Women's Basketball League) is the top women's French professional basketball league. ==HistoryCompetition systemChampions== { bgcolor=\\"#f7f8ff\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;width:90%;text-align:center;margin:auto;\\" -

Whiteless Pike (660 metres high/2,165 ft) is a fell in the north-western English Lake District. It stands immediately east of Crummock Water and forms a pyramid shape when viewed from Rannerdale. In his celebrated guide to the Lakeland fells, Alfred Wainwright called it \\"the Weisshorn of Buttermere\\".Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): There are good views of Great Gable and the Scafells from the summit. ==Topography== The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Whiteless Pike. The highest ground in the North Western Fells is an east-west ridge in this central sector, beginning with Grasmoor above Crummock Water and then gradually descending eastwards over Crag Hill, Sail, Scar Crags and Causey Pike. Grasmoor has the greatest elevation, but Crag Hill stands at the hub of the range. It sends out a subsidiary ridge to the south west, stepping down over Wandope and Whiteless Pike toward Buttermere village. From the broad plateau of Wandope, the fine and airy ridge of Whiteless Edge descends south west to the depression at Saddle Gate (2,065 ft). A short climb then leads to the summit of Whiteless Pike. The ridge now turns south and falls to the wide shoulder of Whiteless Breast (1,440 ft), from where the slope continues down to Buttermere village. This is not however the end of the ridge, which twists sharply north west to continue to Rannerdale Knotts. Both sides of the ridge are steep throughout. The eastern face of the fell drains via several feeders into Sail Beck, bound for Crummock Water via Buttermere Village. The north western flanks supply Rannerdale Beck, another feeder of Crummock Water which flows between Whiteless Pike and Grasmoor. The sharp elbow in the ridge, between Whiteless Pike and Rannerdale Knotts, forms the head of Squat Beck, a tributary of Rannerdale. ==Geology== The summit of the fell is a part of the Kirkstile Formation, Ordovician rocks of the Skiddaw group. This is primarily laminated mudstone and siltstone. The Causey Pike Fault runs across to the south and Whiteless Breast and the lower slopes are examples of the Buttermere Formation, an olistostrome of disrupted sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. Within this are minor intrusions of basalt...British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There is no history of mining on the fell. ==Summit== Whiteless Pike has a small peaked summit overlain with loose stones and bearing a cairn. The steep slopes add foreground to the view, which includes a fine prospect of the Scafells. The Helvellyn range and Western Fells are well seen, with the rather drab close-up of Grasmoor perhaps the only disappointment. Buttermere, Crummock and Loweswater complete the view. ==Ascents== Whiteless Pike seen from the foot of Buttermere, with the summit of Grasmoor on the left Buttermere provides the obvious starting point, climbing on a good path up Whiteless Breast and onto the ridge. From the shore of Crummock Water, access can be gained into Rannerdale, branching off up the course of Squat Beck to the elbow in the ridge between Rannerdale Knotts and Whiteless Pike. Circuits of Rannerdale via the complete ridge of Rannerdale Knotts can also be made.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==References== Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Whiteless Pike"},{"id":"6251024","text":"Charles Angibaud was a French apothecary. He became the royal apothecary to Louis XIV of France, but moved to London to avoid persecution as a Protestant Huguenot. In London, he became Master of the Society of Apothecaries. Charles was born into a family of apothecaries in Saintes, near Bordeaux. He followed his grandfather, Jean, and his father, Daniel, into the family business. Angibaud became the royal apothecary to Louis XIV of France in Paris. Louis presented him with an ornate mortar in 1678 (now in the collection of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in London). Louis had the mortar cast from bell metal (a copper and tin alloy) in the French royal foundry. It has a diameter of 48 cm (19 inches), is 36 cm (14 inches) high, and weighs 129 kilograms (284 pounds). It is decorated with three coats of arms on the front, has ram's heads as handles on either side, and bears an inscription \\"CHARLES ANGIBAVD ME APPRE ET ORDINAIRE DV ROI A PARIS 1678\\". Angibaud left France in 1681, with his wife and three children, moving to London to avoid religious persecution, only a few years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. He became a naturalised British subject. He became a freeman of the Society of Apothecaries on 6 October 1685, enabling him to practice his profession in London. He established his business on St Martin's Lane, selling in particular his Pastilles de Blois made from licorice. His daughter, Martha (Marthe) married another Huguenot apothecary in London, John (Jean) Misaubin, in 1709, who also had premises on St. Martin's Lane and was famously depicted by William Hogarth in a painting in the series, A Harlot's Progress. Angibaud rose high in the Society of Apothecaries. He became a liveryman in 1699, was Renter Warden in 1721, Upper Warden in 1726 and became Master on 22 August 1728. He also enjoyed royal patronage in England. He was appointed an apothecary to Charles II in 1684, and was made Apothecary-General to the Army and Military Hospitals in Ireland under William III and Mary II in 1689. ==External links== *The Mystery of the Sun King's mortar, The Pharmaceutical Journal, vol.275, p. 393 (PDF, 4 pages) *London's immigrant apothecaries, 1600-1800, L G Matthews, Med Hist, July 1974, vol.18(3), p. 262‚Äì274 Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Huguenots Category:French emigrants to the Kingdom of England Category:People from Saintes, Charente-Maritime Category:French pharmacists Category:English apothecaries ","title":"Charles Angibaud"},{"id":"6251040","text":"The Stratford Army Engine Plant.

In 1954 Sikorsky moved the majority of their manufacturing to a new plant on the north side of Stratford, further up the Housatonic River.Stratford, CT (inland) Retrieved 9 August 2011. This move left the Stratford plant vacant, and soon afterward, flooding from the Housatonic River damaged much of the facility. In 1951 the US Air Force had purchased the facility and renamed it Air Force Plant No. 43. Avco Corporation became the contractor operating the plant, repaired the damaged buildings, and built dikes. the same year Avco moved its division Lycoming into the plant, which was a contractor to the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command Textron Lycoming Turbine Engine Retrieved 9 August 2011. and began manufacturing Wright R-1820 piston engines and General Electric J47 components there. In 1952 Lycoming had Anselm Franz set up a turbine engine development effort in the plant and the Lycoming T53, Lycoming T55, Lycoming PLF1, Lycoming LTS101/LPT101, Lycoming ALF 502, Lycoming AGT1500 and Lycoming TF-40 turbine engines were all designed, developed and manufactured in this facility. By 1968, 10,000 people were employed in the plant. In 1976, the plant was transferred from the Air Force to the Army and renamed the 'Stratford Army Engine Plant'. Production of the LTS-101 and LPT-101 turbine engines was moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania beginning in 1980. In 1987 Avco was purchased by Textron to become Textron Lycoming and in 1995, Allied Signal acquired the Lycoming Turbine Engine Division in Stratford. By this time, employment in the plant had fallen to 2,900 people. In July 1995 the Base Realignment and Closure of the United States Department of Defense, recommended closure of the plant. In late 1995, Allied Signal announced that production would be shifted to its facility in Phoenix Arizona. On 30 September 1998, Allied Signal concluded operations in the plant and returned it to the US Army. AGT1500 production was shifted by the Army to the Anniston Army Depot (ANAD)in Anniston, Alabama.Stratford Army Engine Plant (SAEP) Retrieved 9 August 2011. For the next 11 years the Army was involved with \\"Team Stratford\\" to develop the property. On 19 March 2008 the United States Army auctioned the site off with a winning bid of $9,612,000 which also included the facility of over 50 buildings. This bid failed to be paid off and was placed for rebid. Robert Hartmann of Hartmann Development has a $1 billion plan to develop the former plant into a destination resort, dependent on the US government selling him the entire property for one dollar. The Connecticut Air and Space Center occupies part of the site. ==Environmental contamination== Investigation of the brownfield to understand the extent of releases and to determine cleanup are ongoing as of 2014. The wastes of nearly 70 years of aircraft construction included waste oil, fuels, solvents, and paints. An on-site chemical waste treatment plant released effluent to the Housatonic River under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. Beginning in 1980, waste lagoons were regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and part of a 'treatment, storage, or disposal facility'. The lagoons were closed under RCRA during the 1980s. In 1983 the plant was cited for violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding reporting of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing transformers. Subsurface investigations in 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1986, a 1991 Environmental Baseline Survey/Preliminary Assessment Screening by the Corps of Engineers, a 1993 Remedial Investigation Report and a 1996 Environmental Baseline Survey Report have been done. Areas of environmental concern include: \\"Intertidal Flats where runoff and effluent have contaminated sediments with PCBs and metals; a Shoreline Fill Area where subsurface soil and groundwater are contaminated with fuel-related and halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metals; the Plating and Manufacturing Area, where \\"greenish-blue\\" groundwater pumped from the area has been documented to contain metals including chromium and lead, halogenated VOCs, PAHs, and cyanide; the Building B-2/North Parking Lot/West Parking Lot area, where subsurface soils comprise ash and cinder fill and contain PAHs and groundwater is contaminated with halogenated VOCs; Building B-65, where chromium- and petroleum-contaminated soils were discovered; the Research and Development Area, where subsurface soil and groundwater contamination is suspected; the South Parking Lot/Chemical Waste Treatment Plant/Closed Lagoons area, where halogenated VOCs and metals have been detected in groundwater; and the Testing Area, where subsurface soils are contaminated with fuel-related and halogenated VOCs and PAHs, and groundwater is contaminated with halogenated VOCs.\\" Furthermore, surface water and sediment samples downstream of the plant show contamination with halogenated VOCs, PCBs, and metals. Numerous monitoring wells downgradient of the sources on the plant have been dug, and ground water samples also contain fuel-related and halogenated VOCs and metals. ==Remediation== The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) leads oversight of the site's environmental remediation. Before selling the property to the developer 'Point Stratford Renewal' DEEP and the U.S. Army as of June 2014 still need to agree on the degree of clean up the Housatonic riverbed. Residential developers have shown the most interest as of 2014, planning up to 1,500 residential units. Point Stratford Renewal is a collaboration of the three Connecticut companies Loureiro Properties LLC, Development Resources LLC and Sedgwick Partners LLC. In May 2014 the State House of Representatives and the State Senate had passed a bill to create a special tax district at the plant to levy taxes and issue bonds. This will help finance the redevelopment project, particularly road construction, sewage systems, and environmental remediation. ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in Stratford, Connecticut Category:United States Army Materiel Command Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Connecticut Category:Industrial buildings and structures in Connecticut Category:Plants of the United States Air Force ","title":"Stratford Army Engine Plant"},{"id":"6251062","text":"Tom Ang is a photographer, author, traveller and academic.

He was the son of Jos√© Maria Cifuentes Olivares and Paula Espinoza Pinto born in San Felipe, Chile. He married Luz G√≥mez, with whom he fathered 13 children. Cifuentes attended the Instituto Nacional (National Institute) and then studied law at the Universidad de Chile (University of Chile), receiving his law degree in 1861. Cifuentes went on to become a professor at the Colegio San Luis and then the Instituto Nacional. In 1882, he was named a member of the Faculty of Philosophy & Humanities of the Universidad de Chile, and in 1889 he became professor of constitutional rights at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Because of the perceived need for Catholic elements to combat liberals in the press, Cifuentes made contributions to various Chilean periodicals. Together with his former student and fellow Catholic intellectual Zorobabel Rodr√≠guez, Cifuentes founded the daily newspaper El Independiente (The Independent) in 1864. In 1867, Cifuentes helped form the Sociedad de Amigos del Pa√≠s (Society of Friends of the Country) and in 1883 he was one of the founders of the Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica de Chile (Catholic Union of Chile). President German Riesco, accompanied by Abdon Cifuentes, leaves congress (1906) Cifuentes was elected to Parliament as a representative of Rancagua in 1867 and was reelected five times. In 1892, he was elected Senator of Llanquihue in 1892, Aconcagua in 1894, and then Santiago in 1904. In 1871, Abd√≥n Cifuentes was appointed Minister of Public Instruction by President Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu, in which role Cifuentes proposed that state schools refrain from holding exams from private schools (mostly Catholic) and that such tests be carried out in the colleges themselves. It was signed into law January 15, 1872, and caused a strong reaction from lay professors. On January 30, 1872, he signed another law that granted the right to students to study separate branches of law. This attitude greatly troubled the director of the Instituto Nacional, Diego Barros Arana, whom Cifuentes wanted to remove from power, though he was only able to sack part of Barros' faculty. After the students of the Instituto Nacional became disorderly, Barros resigned. The faculty was shaken, and Cifuentes closed the school momentarily to try to reestablish order. His actions in this ordeal were questioned in the congress by Guillermo Antonio Matta, who proposed in 1873 that Cifuentes resign from his post.

He became a clerk for the North West Company, learning the fur business. Losing his job when his employer was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company, McKenzie traveled to St. Louis in 1822, applied for US citizenship and joined the Columbia Fur Company, heading it by the mid-1820s. While he was at fort union he married an Indian woman but later in his life he married a woman named Marry Marshal. == Career == American Fur spent years negotiating,The American Fur Trade and finally met McKenzie's demands in 1827 to buy Columbia Fur. It was renamed the \\"Upper Missouri Outfit\\" division of American Fur,Personal Narrative of Charles Larpenteur, 1833‚Äì1872 and in 1828, McKenzie went up the river to lead the fur trade, building Fort Union near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. Fort Union was ideally situated to dominate the final years of the beaver pelt trade and the beginning of the buffalo hide trade, and many tribes dealt with McKenzie. In 1831, McKenzie succeeded in beginning trade with the native Piegan Blackfeet, eventually building Fort McKenzie in their territory as another trading post.Historic Chronology Of Fort Union Trading Post ‚Äì (obsolete link) In 1832, 1833, and 1834, Congress passed increasingly restrictive laws to keep alcohol out of the hands of Indians.Government of Indian Country and Reservations ‚Äì (obsolete link) American Fur was the company most affected by these laws, and they lobbied heavily against it. Alcohol was inexpensive, easy to transport, and something Indians would always trade for. The company's primary means of transporting furs from and trade goods to their trading posts was by steamboat, and these boats could be inspected at Fort Osage.Alcohol and the Indian Fur Trade ‚Äì (obsolete link) In order to avoid losing out to foreign traders, McKenzie had the parts shipped to him in 1833 to build a distillery at Fort Union. Since it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, they would give away watered-down whiskey, doctored with tobacco, pepper, molasses, and anything else that would give it a kick, one day, and the next, when they were to commence trading, they would give them a non- alcoholic version. In August, 1833, a proud McKenzie showed off his still to M. S. Cerr√© and Nathaniel J. Wyeth. They were outraged at the prices McKenzie was charging for his goods - and the fact that he wouldn't sell them any liquor for their own trade. When the two reached Fort Leavenworth, they reported the still. On June 30, 1834, Congress prohibited distilleries in Indian territory - a law that is still on the books today, although most laws against selling liquor to Indians were repealed in 1948. The distillery at Fort Union effectively ended the career of the American Fur Company's best field trader, Kenneth McKenzie; he was fired.Chittenden, 1902, Vol I, p.xx. In 1834, John Jacob Astor retired, and sold the western division of American Fur to Pierre Chouteau, Jr., who had been Astor's St. Louis agent since 1827.Papers of the St. Louis Fur Trade == Later life == McKenzie spent his last years in Affton, Missouri as a farmer. He died on April 26, 1861 and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. ==See also== Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site Joseph LaBarge Steamboat captain of steamboats used in McKenzie's service ==ReferencesSources== * == External links == * Category:People from Affton, Missouri Category:Canadian fur traders Category:1861 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:American Fur Company people ","title":"Kenneth McKenzie (fur trader)"},{"id":"6251089","text":"\\"Our Town\\" is a song used in the 2006 Disney¬∑Pixar animated film Cars.

The south slope of the mountain faces the western Roanoke Valley and is directly across from Poor Mountain. Fort Lewis Mountain is separated from Brushy Mountain by a narrow gap formed by Masons Creek. Brushy Mountain stretches in the same southwest to northeast direction for several more miles into Botetourt County, Virginia. Another narrow gap separates Fort Lewis Mountain from Little Brushy Mountain, a small 1,926 foot high peak, which is located in Roanoke County just north of Salem, Virginia. The mountain, which had been called Butler Mountain on its west side and Deyerle Mountain on the east, was renamed for Fort Lewis, an early 19th-century fort which was located in western Roanoke County just outside the current city limits of Salem. The fort was named after Andrew Lewis, a colonial era general who lived in the area. This massive chunk of rock, covered with a forest of oak, hemlock, hickory and huge rhododendron, tops out at 3,260 feet above sea level. It's the second highest peak of many that surround Roanoke, one of the least developed or explored. The tallest in the immediate area is Poor Mountain. The mountain is home to the Havens Wildlife Management Area of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.

That graduating class liked the idea of running water on campus \\"in some form or another\\" and rigged the Rock to make a fountain on the south end of campus. The original plumbing was later refitted into a water fountain. Over time, vandalism of the Rock gradually increased, particularly during the Vietnam War. With the first painting of the rock in the 1940s, it became a canvas for student art, opinions, advertising, messages, proposals, and jokes. By tradition, students who wish to paint something on the Rock often guard it from sunrise until the early morning hours before painting. The Rock is no longer one solid piece of quartzite. In 1989 the Rock was moved about 20 feet to accommodate new landscaping, and the work crew moving the Rock dropped it, splitting it up one side and crumbling part of the base. Scientists at McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science provided an epoxy to patch the Rock together again. ==In popular culture== Author Bob Wood discusses The Rock in the Northwestern chapter of his 1989 book Big Ten Country. ==External links== *Webcam of The Rock *Blog about The Rock updated daily with pictures *The Rock, Northwestern University Archives, Evanston, Illinois Category:Northwestern University Category:Landmarks in Chicago Category:Stones ","title":"The Rock (Northwestern University)"},{"id":"6251164","text":"Heyburn may refer to: * Weldon Heyburn (1910‚Äì1951), American film actor * Weldon B.

It is home to Shrewsbury College of Arts and Technology and it is connected to the suburbs of Abbey Foregate and Belvidere. Between these suburbs is Lord Hill's Column, the tallest free-standing Doric column in the world. The Mereside School (a junior school; formerly called Holy Cross) and the Springfield School (an infant school) are located on a site in the Springfield area. The majority of Sutton Farm is a housing estate built in the 1960s, but much older properties existed nearer the Column, and towards the Mere. The original \\"Sutton Farm\\" was located where the current shops and Darwin pub (named after Charles Darwin, who went to school in Shrewsbury) now are. Sutton Farm is in the Anglican Parish of St. Giles' Church, which was once a leper hospital for the Shrewsbury Abbey. In the heart of Sutton Farm is the Mere. This is an open green space with a large lake at the centre. It is said that monks from St. Giles church used to lead lepers to the Mere to bathe, as it was believed the waters had healing properties. Prior to becoming a possession of Shrewsbury Abbey, the manor of Sutton was recorded in the Domesday Book as belonging to Wenlock Priory. On the edge of Sutton Farm, on entering Shrewsbury from Much Wenlock, is Weeping Cross roundabout. (There is also another Mere here, down a steep slope). This again dates back to mediaeval times, and is where the poor in the surrounding countryside left their dead for the monks to give a Christian burial. Not far down the road that skirts Sutton Farm, almost opposite Percy Thrower‚Äôs Garden Centre, is a mediaeval chapel, now used as Shrewsbury Greek Orthodox Church, dedicated to the Holy Fathers. This is a very ancient church, and archaeology suggests it was probably pre-dated by earlier stone and wooden churches, and the site could even date back to early Christianity in this part of the country, to a time when people were moving out of the old Roman city of Viroconium, which is not too far away. On heading into Shrewsbury there is a green belt of land on the eastern edge of Sutton Farm, known as the Rea Brook Valley. In here is the remains of a long mill race and levelling ponds built by the monks, who had water mills situated in the valley. Until more recent times, the former site of Salop Laundry (now replaced with new houses), was known by locals as the \\"mill\\" and is believed to be a site of one of the mills. Along the mill race towards Lord Hill's Column are some old bridges and ancient bridge embankments, one of which is called \\"Leper's Bridge\\", and is said to be where the monks led the lepers up to St. Giles Church which is at the top of the hill.

After earning her Licence √®s Lettres degree in Morocco, she received a fellowship to study in the United Kingdom (UK), where she earned an MA in linguistics. In 1992 Lalami moved to the United States, where she completed a PhD in linguistics at the University of Southern California. She began publishing her writing in 1996. Her first novel, composed of linked stories, was published in 2005. In 2015 she was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction for her 2014 novel The Moor's Account, which received strong critical praise and won several other awards. == Early life and education== Lalami was born in a working-class family in Rabat, Morocco. She spoke Moroccan Arabic at home, and learned Standard Arabic and French in elementary school.Author's Narrative Bio, Lalami Narrative Bio, Author's website, 2019. According to Lalami, all the children's books she read as a child were written in French, and she began to write her own stories in French. \\"The characters‚Äô names, their homes, their cities, their lives were wholly different from my own,\\" she explained, \\"and yet, because of my constant exposure to them, they had grown utterly familiar. These images invaded my imaginary world to such an extent that I never thought they came from an alien place.\\" While her parents both read widely in a variety of genres and encouraged her writing, Lalami has said that they thought she needed to study a profession other than writing. Lalami earned her Licence √®s Lettres in English from Mohammed V University in Rabat. In 1990, she received a British Council fellowship to study in England and completed an MA in Linguistics at University College London. After graduating, she returned to Morocco and worked briefly as a journalist and commentator. In 1992 she moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California, from which she graduated with a PhD in Linguistics. She had chosen the field of linguistics in order to be involved with the study of language, even in analysis. Her experiences and studies caused her to reflect on the uses of French and Arabic in Morocco. She was influenced by the work of Edward Said, and became aware of the code switching followed by her and her family, and most native Moroccans, in their transitions between the two. Writing professionally in English, she said, gave her another perspective.Laila Lalami, \\"So to Speak\\" (essay), World Literature Today website, September 2009 == Career == Lalami began writing fiction and nonfiction in English in 1996.Interview, Writers & Books, 2008.

It follows four Moroccan immigrants who try to cross the Straits of Gibraltar on a lifeboat, which capsizes offshore. The book has an unusual narrative structure: the opening story takes place while the main characters are making the crossing; the next four stories flash back to the characters' lives before their fateful journey; and the final four stories flash forward, so that the reader learns the fates of the four. Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits received wide critical acclaim. In the Washington Post, Carolyn See described it as \\"a bracing and beautiful little novel.\\" Pankaj Mishra, writing in the New York Review of Books, noted that \\"Lalami writes about her home country without the expatriate's self-indulgent and often condescending nostalgia.\\" Lalami's second book, the novel Secret Son (2009), is a coming-of-age story set in the slums of Casablanca. A young college student named Youssef El Mekki discovers that his father‚Äîwhom he'd been led to believe was a high school teacher, and dead for many years‚Äîis in fact a businessman and lives across town. But Youssef's burgeoning relationship with his father, and his sudden change in fortune, are threatened by social and political unrest in the city. The novel explores themes of identity and class in a world increasingly divided by political ideology.Thorne, John. \\"Profile: Lalani Lalami\\", The National Secret Son was longlisted for the Orange Prize.\\"Levy, Mantel battle 7 debut novels for Orange prize\\", Reuters, 17 March 2010 The Moor's Account, Lalami's third book, was published by Pantheon Books in September 2014.

It formed a triple junction with the Izanagi and Farallon plates in the Panthalassa Ocean as early as 410 million years ago, during which time the Phoenix Plate was subducting under eastern Gondwana. By the Late Jurassic‚ÄìEarly Cretaceous 150‚Äì130 million years ago, the Pacific Plate arose from the Izanagi-Farallon-Phoenix triple junction, resulting in the creation of the Izanagi-Pacific-Phoenix and Farallon-Pacific-Phoenix triple junctions. Subduction ceased east of Australia about 120 million years ago, during which time a transform/transpressional boundary formed. This transform/transpressional boundary with the Phoenix Plate lasted until about 80 million years ago as the plate continued to descend southwards as a result of Late Cretaceous subduction under the Antarctic Peninsula. During the Late Cretaceous or early Cenozoic, the southwestern part of the Phoenix Plate fragmented into the Charcot Plate, much in the same way in which the Rivera and Cocos plates were formed by the fragmentation of the Farallon Plate. The Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge, a mid-oceanic ridge between the Antarctic and Phoenix plates, initiated following Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic times when the Phoenix Plate had divergent boundaries with the Bellingshausen and Pacific plates in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. A major decrease in spreading rate of the Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge and the convergence rate of the Phoenix Plate with the Antarctic Plate occurred around 52.3 million years ago, followed by subduction of a segment of the Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge between 50 and 43 million years ago. Although active subduction occurred for over 100 million years, it stopped or slowed dramatically about 3.3 million years ago when seafloor spreading on the Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge ceased, leaving a small remnant of the former Phoenix Plate incorporated in the Antarctic Plate. This remnant underlies the southwest Drake Passage and is surrounded by the Shackleton Fracture Zone in the northeast, the Hero Fracture Zone in the southwest, the South Shetland Trough in the southeast and the extinct Antarctic-Phoenix Ridge in the northwest. ==References== Category:Historical tectonic plates Category:Devonian geology Category:Carboniferous geology Category:Permian geology Category:Triassic geology Category:Jurassic geology Category:Cretaceous geology Category:Paleogene geology Category:Neogene geology Category:Geology of the Southern Ocean Category:Natural history of Antarctica ","title":"Phoenix Plate"},{"id":"6251230","text":"Daniel Mart√≠n Garc√≠a (born 19 February 1977) is a Spanish singer.

As he was not a really good student, he started to work with his father and, at the same time, he began to study at the Drama School William Layton. Later, Dani decided to attend prestigious Drama School Cristina Rota, where he got his first jobs as a stage actor. The first time he appeared on television was with Martes y 13 in a show prepared for New Year‚Äôs Eve. Then, he presented a program called Ponte las Pilas. He has acted in several films, such as Sirenas by Fernando Leon de Aranoa, Sin verg√ºenza by Joaqu√≠n Oristrell, Auger Carlos Villaverde, Manuel Sanabria, and Yo soy la Juani by Bigas Luna. He was also acted in TV series such as Al salir de clase, Polic√≠as, en el coraz√≥n de la calle, Raquel busca su sitio, Petra Delicado, 7 vidas, Hospital Central, Los hombres de Paco and a small role in the movie Broken Embraces, directed by Pedro Almod√≥var. In 2000, Dani Martin created the music band El Canto del Loco and he started to combine his job as an actor with his new job as a singer. Between 2007-2008 he starred in a series called Cuenta Atr√°s, in which he played the role of an impulsive police chief inspector called Paul Corso. Dani Martin decided to leave the series in order to devote himself completely to the group El Canto del Loco. ===Albums=== ;with El Canto del Loco *2000: El Canto del Loco *2002: A contracorriente *2003: Estados de √°nimo *2005: Zapatillas *2008: Personas *2009: Radio la colifata presenta: El Canto del Loco ;Solo *2010: Peque√±o *2011: Peque√±o...

Subscribers could play tracks available in its catalog on a variety of digital devices, including computers, handheld devices, Sonos systems and television. MOG also allowed users to access aggregated editorial content from music blogs, user posts, and in-house editors. MOG was founded by David Hyman, formerly CEO of Gracenote, SVP of Marketing at MTV Interactive, and Director of Ad Sales for Addicted to Noise. It was privately held and headquartered in Berkeley, CA. The company raised $24.9 million in capital from a variety of sources, including Balderton Capital, Menlo Ventures, Simon Equity, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music. Music producer Rick Rubin was a member of MOG's board of directors. After purchasing MOG in 2012, Beats Electronics in January 2014 announced that the MOG service would shut down in the United States on 15 April 2014. This date was first indefinitely postponed,http://support.beatsmusic.com/hc/en- us/articles/200790370-What-happens-to-the-MOG-service-and-subscribers- but then it was shut down on May 31, 2014.https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/1/5770370/mog-streaming-music-service- shut-down Its successor system, Beats Music, launched in the United States on 21 January 2014 and then was in turn acquired by Apple Inc. in May 2014. ==History== Founded in June 2005, MOG began as a music-themed social network and blog network. Users could create profiles with information about their music tastes, and the MOG-O-MATIC client application assisted in the process by scanning users' music libraries and populating their profiles with information about their music collection and listening activities. MOG also recommended users with similar music tastes. Users could compose blog posts, read posts composed by other users, and listen to 30-second samples of songs. In late 2007, MOG partnered with Rhapsody to allow Rhapsody subscribers to access all of Rhapsody's content through MOG. In August 2008, MOG launched the MOG Music Network, a music ad network that aggregated posts from affiliate blogs and those created by MOG's in-house music editors. In December 2009, MOG launched a subscription music service, which allowed subscribers to stream any song in MOG's catalog to their computer through a web browser. In July 2010, MOG released mobile applications for iPhone, iPod Touch, and phones using the Android operating system, allowing subscribers to also access MOG's catalog from these devices. In September 2010, MOG announced the release of a Roku channel, which enables subscribers to access the service from their television. In June 2011, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic pre-released his album Alpocalypse on the MOG website. In March 2012, reports surfaced that Beats Electronicsan audio equipment company then majority-owned by mobile phone maker HTC, was planning to acquire MOG. In April 2012, MOG announced a partnership with Telstra to bring MOG to Australia, the first region outside of the US to have access. Telstra and MOG launched under the BigPond Music branding on 21 June 2012. This partnership also allows Telstra customers to stream without the content counting towards their data quota. In July 2012, it was officially confirmed that Beats would acquire MOG's music streaming service for $14 million The acquisition did not include MOG's advertising network, the MOG Music Network, which was sold in a separate deal on 24 August 2012 to the radio broadcasting and media company Townsquare Media. In January 2014, it was announced that MOG would be discontinued on 15 April 2014 in favor of Beats Music, and that existing subscribers would receive refunds. The shutdown was delayed to 31 May 2014. Former MOG subscribers were offered a free, 60-day trial of Beats Music. In Australia, MOG was offered through Telstra's BigPond Music (BPM) service. Telstra officially announced the closure of MOG on July 31, and the service ceased to operate on 11:59PM August 31.https://www.zdnet.com/article/telstra-announces-closure-of-music-streaming- service-mog/ ==Features== MOG's Web Player MOG was a subscription service that allows users to play tracks from its catalog on a variety of digital devices, including computers, handheld devices, Sonos system and television (through MOG's Roku channel). The company claimed that its catalog was 16 million tracks, although it is not clear how the count was produced or audited. Songs could be streamed via the internet or stored on their devices so that they could be played without internet connection. Web streams were 320kbit/s MP3 fileshttp://support.mog.com/kb/general-information/what-audio-quality-bitrate- does-mog-support and mobile streams were 48 kbit/s AAC+ files. Users could choose whether mobile downloads were 'high-quality' 320kbit/s MP3 files or 48 kbit/s AAC+ files. MOG Radio, accessible through any of the platforms mentioned above, generated a continuous play queue based on the artist chosen by the user. By adjusting a slider within the MOG player (pictured at right) between Artist Only and Similar Artists, the user determined whether the radio plays only songs by the selected artist, or whether and how often songs by what the application determined to be \\"similar artists\\" were added to the queue. When a user's song selection ends, MOG Radio begins to play and continued until the user makes another selection. The MOG Music Network was a music blog network that aggregated original content by in-house editors and syndicated content from more than 1,300 affiliate blogs. Affiliates signed up to reach MOG's 38 million monthly unique visitors in the US (as of April 2011) who clicked through from blog post excerpts on MOG to read the full post on the affiliate site. ==See also== * Deezer * Grooveshark * Guvera * Last.fm * List of online music databases * Pandora * rara.com * Rdio * Rhapsody (online music service) * Simfy * Songza * SoundCloud * Spotify * Soundtracker (music streaming) * Streaming media * WiMP ==References * MOG Homepage Category:Blog networks Category:American music websites Category:Online music and lyrics databases ","title":"MOG (online music)"},{"id":"6251279","text":"Tsering Woeser (also written √ñser; ; , Han name Ch√©ng W√©ns√† Á®ãÊñáËê®; born 1966) is a Tibetan writer, activist, blogger, poet and essayist. ==Biography== Woeser, a quarter Han Chinese and three quarters Tibetan, was born in Lhasa. Her grandfather, Chinese, was an officer in the Nationalist Army of the Kuomintang and her father was a high rank Army officer in the People's Liberation Army. When she was very young, her family relocated to the Kham area of western Sichuan province. In 1988, she graduated from Southwest University for Nationalities in Chengdu with a degree in Chinese literature. She worked as a reporter in Kardz√© and later in Lhasa and has lived in Beijing since 2003 as a result of political problems. Woeser is married to Wang Lixiong, a renowned author who frequently writes about Tibet. According to Reporters sans fronti√®res, \\"Woeser is one of the few Tibetan authors and poets to write in Chinese.\\" When the government refused to give her a passport, she sued the authorities.Tibetan writer, a rare outspoken voice against Beijing's policies, sues Chinese government Herald Tribune July 23, 2008 p. 1 (iht.com) ==Career== Video to honor Woeser by the Prince Claus Fund for her 2011 award Woeser is the author of the book, Notes on Tibet (Ë•øËóèÁ¨îËÆ∞, Xƒ´z√†ng B«êj√¨). The Tibet Information Network quotes unnamed sources that the book was banned by the government around September 2003. According to UNPO, shortly after the alleged ban, Woeser was also fired from her job and lost her status with her work unit. Radio Free Asia reported that she continued to post a variety of poems and articles to her two blogs: Maroon Map (ÁªõÁ∫¢Ëâ≤ÁöÑÂú∞Âõæ, oser.tibetcul.net), which, according to the author, was visited primarily by Tibetans and the Woeser blog (blog.daqi.com/weise), which was visited primarily by those of Han ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by order of the government, apparently in response to postings in which she expressed birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and touched on other sensitive topics. Woeser stated that she would continue writing and speaking. Woeser in her Beijing apartment in 2009 in front of her Tibetan Buddhist altar During the Tibetan unrest of 2008, Woeser and her husband were put under house arrest after speaking to reporters.

Liu Xiaobo, the author of Charter 08, was sentenced for eleven years of prison and awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.

It is often climbed as part of a popular ridge walk, from Black Sail youth hostel, or from Buttermere via Scarth Gap. Panoramas of the Great Gable and the Scafells are visible. ==Topography== The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): The highest section of the northern branch is formed by the trio of Buttermere fells, High Crag, High Stile and Red Pike. The Buttermere Fells, also known as Buttermere Edge,Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): form the watershed between Buttermere and Upper Ennerdale. The Ennerdale flanks are steep and rough, put with only small areas of crag, the lower slopes being planted with a ribbon of conifers. Across the narrow ridge-top to the north are deep corries and dark walls of crag, glowering down over the lake. The ridge continues south east to Haystacks and the Great Gable group. Beyond Red Pike to the west are Starling Dodd, Great Borne and the Loweswater Fells. High Crag forms the eastern terminus of the Buttermere Fells, its most arresting feature being the great scree slopes of Gamlin End where the high ground falls away. 700 ft below, the ridge levels out once more and throws up the craggy top of Seat (1,840 ft). A final steep descent then leads to Scarth Gap, a walkers' pass between Buttermere and Ennerdale. All three Buttermere Fells throw out a rocky spur toward the lake, these walls enclosing Birkness and Bleaberry Combs. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. Drained into Buttermere by Comb Beck, its headwall is rimmed by crags on all sides. Sheepbone Buttress flanks High Crag, which also has a share in Comb Crags, lining the onward ridge. It is the great scooped hollow of the Comb which results in the narrowness of Buttermere Edge. The northern spur also ends abruptly as High Crag Buttress, a further tier of rock lying just above the lakeshore. ==Geology== The summit rocks are of the Birker Fell Formation, plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas. Interbeds of volcaniclastic sandstone and lapilli-tuff also appear. Seat is an outcrop of the flow banded andesite lavas of the Haystacks Member, shot through with quartz-feldspar phyric microgranite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There was small scale mining activity in the late nineteenth century beneath Low Wax Knott, adjacent to the Scarth Gap path. Two men worked the operation, living on the fellside in a hut. A search was organised after their regular visits to the local hostelry abruptly ceased, and one was found dead in a pool at Warnscale. It was suspected that the other had killed him.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) ==Summit== The triangular summit has a cairn at the high point above Gamlin End. The view is restricted by High Stile, but the head of Ennerdale- backed by the Scafells- presents a fine picture. More distant glimpses of Skiddaw and the Helvellyn range are also granted. A short walk north west toward the top of the crags brings Buttermere and Crummock Water into sight. ==Ascents== Scarth Gap can be gained from the head of Ennerdale, but this is a long walk from anywhere except Black Sail Youth Hostel. Scarth Gap provides the more regular approach from the Buttermere valley, parking being available at Gatesgarth. On the Buttermere side a path cuts off the corner at the top of the pass and removes the need to first ascend Seat, before the long assault on the screes of Gamlin End. From the shore of Buttermere Wainwright noted that an ascent may be made via Birkness Comb, climbing a grassy rake through the crags. ==References== Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"High Crag"},{"id":"6251295","text":"Iranian hip hop, also referred to as Persian hip hop, refers to hip hop music developed in Iran. It is rooted in American hip hop culture, but it has sometimes incorporated local elements such as Iranian classical music and literature. ==History== Iranian hip hop originates from Tehran, the country's capital city, although a number of experimental works were recorded earlier by diasporan Iranian musicians, particularly in Los Angeles. Iranian rappers started out by recording mixtapes. Some combined hip hop with Iranian elements, such as Iran's classical music. Hip hop music in Iran has often been an underground movement. On several occasions, recording studios have been shut down, websites have been blocked, and artists have been arrested. Only a few works have been officially approved by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Hip hop dance is also present in underground movements, with few performances having received limited permission. Iran's premier rap group, 021, named after the telephone area code of Tehran, was founded during the 1990s. Hichkas, the lead figure of this group, came to be one of Iran's earliest renowned rappers, and therefore nicknamed the Father of Persian Rap. His well-received album Jangale Asfalt (\\"Asphalt Jungle\\"), produced by Mahdyar Aghajani, was the first Iranian hip hop album. It incorporated a fusion with traditional Persian harmonies and contributed remarkably to the evolution of hip hop in Iran. The 021 music group was co-founded by the Yashar and Shayan duo, later renamed Vaajkhonyaa. Zedbazi, founded in April 2002, is regarded as the pioneer of gangsta rap in Iran. The band quickly gained a huge popularity among the youth, due mainly to their use of explicit lyrics, littered with profanity and depictions of sex and drug use. They are credited with starting a new movement in Iranian music. Bahram Nouraei, who was once arrested, was listed as one of the \\"50 People Shaping The Culture Of The Middle East\\" by HuffPost in August 2012. His most popular work, Inja Irane (\\"Here is Iran\\"), was described as a \\"poignant critique of the country\\" by Rolling Stone. Yas was the first Iranian rapper to be authorized to perform in Iran. He reached national fame through his song CD ro Beshkan (\\"Break the Disk\\"), which was written about an Iranian actress who was subjected to a sex tape scandal. On 21 December 2011, he was chosen by voters as the \\"Artist of the Week\\" on MTV, entitled \\"Tehran's Hard-Hitting MC\\". The restrictions have been more stringent on women. Salome MC, who started her career collaborating with Hichkas, was one of the first women to contribute to Iranian hip hop. She was named as an influential and \\"revolutionizing\\" artist by MTV and Time. ==SamplesSee also== * Music of Iran * Graffiti in Iran * Dance in Iran * List of Iranian hip hop artists ==References== Hip hop ","title":"Iranian hip hop"},{"id":"6251315","text":"The Harlequin Tea Set is a short story collection written by Agatha Christie and first published in the US by G.

A$1 coin for scale. Diamictite (; from Ancient Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ± (dia-): through and ¬µŒµŒπŒ∫œÑœåœÇ (meikt√≥s): mixed) is a type of lithified sedimentary rock that consists of nonsorted to poorly sorted terrigenous sediment containing particles that range in size from clay to boulders, suspended in a matrix of mudstone or sandstone. The term was coined by Richard Foster Flint and others as a purely descriptive term, devoid of any reference to a particular origin.Flint, R.F., J.E. Sanders, and J. Rodgers (1960) Diamictite, a substitute term for symmictite Geological Society of America Bulletin. 71(12):1809‚Äì1810. Some geologists restrict the usage to nonsorted or poorly sorted conglomerate or breccia that consists of sparse, terrigenous gravel suspended in either a mud or sand matrix.Tucker, M.E. (2003) Sedimentary Rocks in the Field John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., New York, New York. 244 pp. Unlithified diamictite is referred to as diamicton. The term diamictite is often applied to nonsorted or poorly sorted, lithified glacial deposits such as glacial tillite and boulder clay, and diamictites are often mistakenly interpreted as having an essentially glacial origin (see Snowball Earth). The most common origin for diamictites, however, is deposition by submarine mass flows like turbidites and olistostromes in tectonically active areas, and they can be produced in a wide range of other geological conditions.

Since 2010, the population of Brooklyn was estimated by the Census Bureau to have increased 3.5% to 2,592,149 as of 2013, representing 30.8% of New York City's population, 33.5% of Long Island's population, and 13.2% of New York State's population. If the boroughs of New York City were separate cities, Brooklyn would be the third largest city in the United States after Los Angeles and Chicago. According to the 2010 Census, 35.7% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 31.9% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 10.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.4% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.6% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 19.8% of Brooklyn's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). ==Households== Of its 880,727 households 33.3% have children under the age of 18 living in them, 38.6% were married couples living together, 22.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.7% were non-families. Of all households 27.8% are made up of individuals, and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.41. In the County the population was spread out, with 26.9% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. For every 100 females there were 88.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.1 males. ==Income== The median income for a household in the County was $32,135, and the median income for a family was $36,188. Males had a median income of $34,317 versus $30,516 for females. The per capita income for the County was $16,775. About 22.0% of families and 25.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.0% of those under age 18 and 21.5% of those age 65 or over. ==Race and ethnicity== According to the 2009 American Community Survey, White Americans made up 54.6% of Brooklyn's population. Black Americans made up 34.2% of Brooklyn's population; non-Hispanic blacks made up 32.9% of the population. Native Americans made up 0.3% of Brooklyn's population. Asian Americans made up 9.5% of the population; Pacific Islander Americans made up 0.1% of the populace. Multiracial Americans made up 1.4% of Brooklyn's population. Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 19.6% of Brooklyn's population. ===European Americans=== According to the 2009 American Community Survey, white Americans made up a majority (54.6%) of Brooklyn's population, of which 51.9% are non- Hispanic whites. Whites (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic) number near 1.3 million individuals, and there are nearly 1,150,000 non-Hispanic whites residing in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's European American population mainly consists of ethnic Europeans who are either from or descendants from Eastern and Southern European countries of Italy, Russia, Poland, Albania, and former Soviet Union countries, as well as Ireland. Northwest and the Southern half sections of Brooklyn are predominantly European American communities, and most of the borough's European American residents are of the Catholic or Jewish faith. Amongst Catholics, Italian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Williamsburg, East Williamsburg, Bergen Beach, and Mill Basin. Polish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Greenpoint (\\"Little Poland\\") and Greenwood Heights; Russian Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay; and Irish Americans are the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Bay Ridge, Gerritsen Beach, and Marine Park. Brooklyn is 22.4% Jewish with Jews being the predominant ethnic group in neighborhoods such as Borough Park, Williamsburg, Midwood, Ocean Parkway, a portion of Crown Heights, and a portion of Flatbush. Although Northwestern and the Southern half sections of Brooklyn are mainly populated by European American communities, however they are not all exclusively European Americans as there are also a few large Latino communities that are intertwined with the European American communities in western Brooklyn such as Williamsburg/East Williamsburg and a portion of Sunset Park with some overlap into Greenwood Heights and Prospect Park. In the southern half of Brooklyn, there are several large Asian communities, mostly Chinese with some southeast Asians intertwined and surrounded by the European American communities mainly in a portion of Sunset Park and Bensonhurst/Gravesend and on a smaller scale Sheepshead Bay and Flatbush/Midwood. Neighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Canarsie, and East New York were previously overwhelmingly majority Jewish and Italian with Germans and Irish in some sections in early-mid 20th century, but in the later part of the 20th century they slowly shifted into majority Black communities with a few Puerto Rican communities interspersed in Bushwick and a portion of East New York.The Tipping Point , article copied from The New Yorker, June 3, 1996 However, a portion of Crown Heights and a portion of Flatbush still have a significant Jewish and European American communities and in Spring Creek, which is a subsection of East New York still have some significant scattered numbers of European Americans intermixed with the predominantly African American community. Within recent years, the Jewish population and other European Americans, mainly high income professionals has started regrowing in Fort Greene, Crown Heights, Flatbush and Bedford Stuyvesant in significant numbers due to the Jewish American population growing and spilling over from still existing Jewish communities nearby such as from Williamsburg, southern Crown Heights and on a smaller scale, Flatbush and as well as rapid gentrification has been happening since the 2000s. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race- map.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/projects/census/2010/map.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/last- battle-brooklyn-new-york-americas-most-unaffordable-place-buy- homehttps://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/jewish-push-into-bed-stuy-sheds- light-on-gentrification/https://www.brownstoner.com/brooklyn-life/big- demographic-shift-in-bed-stuy-as-whites-move- in/https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/05/mapping-the-transformation-of-new- york-city/525330/https://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/napoli13/brooklyn-jews/ According to the 2009 American Community Survey, the six most common European ancestries were the following. {  - ! Ancestry ! Number ! % of total population -  Italian  157,068  6.1% -  Irish  100,923  3.9% -  Russian  88,766  3.5% -  Polish  71,099  2.8% -  German  53,188  2.1% -  English  36,174  1.4% } ===African Americans=== According to the 2009 American Community Survey, African Americans made up over one-third (34.2%) of Brooklyn's population. There are over 877,000 African Americans residing in Brooklyn. The historical African American cultural center of the borough has long been Bedford-Stuyvesant; African Americans became a majority in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the 1930s following the construction of the A line subway between Harlem and Bedford.http://www.1940snewyork.com/ https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc- population/historical- population/1920_black.pdfhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc- population/historical- population.pagehttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data- maps/nyc-population/historical-population/1920_white_fb.pdfAs a result, Bedford Stuyvesant, which is in the northern section of Brooklyn was an extension of Harlem's black community as well as Brooklyn's earliest first established large African American community, although some of their population did intermix into other surrounding neighborhoods which were then heavily dominated Jewish and Italian communities including some Germans in Bushwick, Fort Greene, Ocean-Hill, Brownsville and East New York during the early part of 20th century. Bed-Stuy on the Move Neighborhoods surrounding Bedford-Stuyvesant in Northern, Central and North Eastern sections of Brooklyn such as Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Canarsie, East Flatbush, Crown Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, East New York, Spring Creek and Fort Greene, which were still dominantly Jewish and Italian communities along with some Irish and Germans and continued to surround Bedford Stuyvesant's large African American community until the 1950s-70s also began to get large influxes of African Americans starting in the 1950s until the 1970s as large numbers of African Americans continued to move into Brooklyn with their desire to be near Bedford Stuyvesant's African American community and eventually they all also transitioned into majority African American communities by the 1980s-2000s with a portion of Crown Heights that has still remained Jewish, however there are also large Caribbean/West Indian black communities intermixed in, which most of them are in East Flatbush, Canarsie and a portion of Crown Heights. https://www.socialexplorer.com/a9676d974c/explore After Bedford Stuyvesant, which was once mostly populated by upper class Europeans, Jewish, and Italians became the first Brooklyn area to become a majority African American neighborhood during the 1930s-40s, nearby neighborhoods going further northeast of Brooklyn such as Ocean-Hill, Brownsville and East New York sections including a portion of Crown Heights just below Bedford Stuyvesant, which were all formerly majority Jewish and Italian neighborhoods until the 1960s were the next following areas to transition into African American communities, which started happening in the 1950s, but it was more towards the late 1960s and early 1970s when they fully became majority African American communities. East Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens, which are located in the central portion of Brooklyn just south of Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights and were majority Italian/Jewish/Irish neighborhoods until the early 1970s became the later sections to become majority African American and West Indian/Caribbean black communities, which the transition happened more towards the mid 1970s to 1980s. Canarsie, which is located in the far eastern portion, but upper middle of Brooklyn below East New York and east of East Flatbush in northeast Brooklyn was mainly a Jewish and Italian majority neighborhood until the 1990s was the final large neighborhood in northern Brooklyn to become a majority African American and West Indian/Caribbean black community by the mid 1990s-2000s. As a result, most of the northern half of Brooklyn is dominated by African American including Caribbean Black communities clustered all together although there is still a Jewish enclave in a portion of Crown Heights now overwhelmingly surrounded by Brooklyn's majority African American and West Indian/Caribbean neighborhoods and as well as there are still significant scattered numbers of European Americans in Spring Creek's majority African American enclave, however the very northern sections of Brooklyn such as Bushwick, Cypress Hills and a portion of East New York are primarily Latino communities and north west sections of Brooklyn such as Williamsburg, Green Point, Cobble Hill, Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, Carroll Gardens, Park Slope are still mainly European American communities with a large Latino community in East Williamsburg and some Latinos intermixed in Carroll Gardens/Park Slope/Gowanus until this day, although they have become a lot more gentrified now. Red Hook, which is in the western northern part of Brooklyn at the very western tip by the ocean also has a significant African American population, however it is a little bit distant away about a mile or more from most of the predominant African American communities of Brooklyn since Red Hook is surrounded by predominantly European American, now very gentrified communities of northwest Brooklyn. In the very southern tip of Brooklyn, Coney Island also has a significant African American population, which is a lot more far away from most of the dominantly African American neighborhoods in northern Brooklyn since the southern half of Brooklyn is still mostly European American communities largely Jewish and Italian, but also with Eastern Europeans and Greeks and now also more recently emerged Asian American communities, mainly Chinese with some southeast Asians. Together all these predominantly Black neighborhoods have a population of about 940,000 and are roughly 82% African American, making it the largest African-American community in the United States. The roads of Eastern Parkway, Malcolm X Boulevard, Kings Highway, Broadway, Atlantic Avenue, Linden Boulevard, Flatlands Avenue and Jackie Robinson Parkway connect several of these neighborhoods. However, due to recent years of gentrification going on in these areas particularly Fort Greene, Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Flatbush, the African American communities have been declining as the high income professional white population residents have been soaring largely in these areas since the 2000s. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race- map.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/projects/census/2010/map.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/last- battle-brooklyn-new-york-americas-most-unaffordable-place-buy- homehttps://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/jewish-push-into-bed-stuy-sheds- light-on-gentrification/https://www.brownstoner.com/brooklyn-life/big- demographic-shift-in-bed-stuy-as-whites-move- in/https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/05/mapping-the-transformation-of-new- york-city/525330/https://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/napoli13/brooklyn-jews/ ===Caribbean Americans=== According to the 2010 US Census data on brooklyn.com there are approximately 370,000 (16.4%) Caribbean descendants in Brooklyn. That figure includes persons who identify with the Dominican Republic (3.3%), but does not include the (7.4%) Puerto Rican population. Including Puerto Ricans there are approximately 560,000 (23.8%) persons of Caribbean descent in Brooklyn. Similar, but not identical demographics in America can be found in Miami, but there are not as many Cubans in New York. A large population of Brooklyn's Caribbean decedents are of Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Haitian, Saint Lucians and Guyanese immigrants. ===Hispanics and Latinos=== According to the 2009 American Community Survey, Hispanics and Latinos made up nearly one-fifth (19.6%) of Brooklyn's population. Over 500,000 Hispanics and Latinos reside in Brooklyn. Nearly 190,000 Puerto Ricans call the borough home, and they make up 7.4% of the population. The borough's 91,000 Mexican Americans make up 3.6% of its population. In the Northern sections of Brooklyn such as Bushwick, East Williamsburg, Cypress Hills and a portion of East New York are home to most of Brooklyn's large Hispanic communities mainly from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America and have become the majority in these neighborhoods, which were formerly majority African American neighborhoods during the 1960s-70s and before the African Americans, they were formerly majority Italian/Jewish/German neighborhoods from the 1920s-60s. The Hispanic/Latino communities in North Brooklyn are mostly located very north of the currently existing African American communities of Brooklyn such as Bushwick in the very north central section of Brooklyn and Cypress Hills/north portion of East New York in very northeastern section of Brooklyn as most of the northern half of Brooklyn, which were formerly Jewish and Italian majority neighborhoods are currently majority African American/Caribbean black neighborhoods although some of the Latino and Hispanic populations do spillover into the predominant black communities such as Brownsville/East New York near Cypress hills and Bedford Stuyvesant next to Bushwick. However the Hispanic/Latino community in Williamsburg/East Williamsburg, which is in northwest of Brooklyn are intertwined between many European American enclaves consisting of Jewish and Italians including many high income professionals known as hipsters as the northwestern portion of Brooklyn are still mainly European American enclaves, however some of the Latino/Hispanic population do intermix into Carroll Gardens, Gowanus, Boerum Hill, Red Hook, and Prospect Park sections, which are all in the northwest portion of Brooklyn, but due to the gentrification that is happening rapidly in northwestern sections of Brooklyn, the Latino/Hispanic population is facing a threat of decline in those sections. However, in Southwest Brooklyn, there is also a large Hispanic community in Sunset Park, which is neighbored by Brooklyn's largest Chinese enclave known as Brooklyn's Chinatown to the east of Sunset Park and neighbored by a few small scattered enclaves of European Americans to the north of Sunset Park and north east heading into Park Slope. In recent years, a growing number of Hispanic/Latinos, mainly Mexicans and other Central Americans have started appearing significantly in other parts of the southern half of Brooklyn, but at this time, they still have no newly emerged large enclaves except for Sunset Park since they are scattered and are integrated in Bensonhurst/Gravesend/Bath Beach's currently majority Italian/Jewish and Chinese enclaves; also including small numbers of Muslims and Arabs. Brighton Beach, which is in the southeast portion of Brooklyn and is mainly populated by Russians and other former USSR nationalities also has a significant scattered Latino/Hispanic population. Sheepshead Bay, which is also in southeast Brooklyn is also populated by many Russian speakers and also has a small significant Latino/Hispanic population. https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/05/mapping-the-transformation-of-new-york- city/525330/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race- map.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/projects/census/2010/map.html Brooklyn Chinatown ===Asian Americans=== Over 243,000 Asians live in the borough. The most numerous Asian American group are those of Chinese descent. Chinese Americans make up 6.4% of the borough's population, and they number over 163,000 individuals. Much of Brooklyn's Asian population is concentrated in Southern Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Sunset Park (\\"Brooklyn's Chinatown\\"), Homecrest, Sheepshead Bay (\\"Avenue U Chinatown\\") and Bensonhurst. (\\"Bensonhurst Chinatown\\") The Chinese were second only to Queens among New York boroughs, meaning Manhattan's Chinatown is no longer the main residence of Chinese in the city. So far, Sunset Park, which was formerly a Norwegian neighborhood and is located in the southwestern portion of Brooklyn carries the largest Chinatown of Brooklyn since the Chinese population began growing in Sunset Park during the 1980s-90s and is neighbored by a large Latino/Hispanic community to the west of Sunset Park. Bensonhurst, which is located in the southern central part of Brooklyn and Sheepshead Bay, which is located in southeastern Brooklyn were formerly majority Italian and Jewish enclaves until the 2000s did not get the large influx of Chinese until more towards the mid 1990s, but spiked more towards the 2000s resulting now in several small newer Chinatowns in several sections of Bensonhurst and a section of Sheepshead Bay. However, Bensonhurst's Chinese population all together is enough to create another large Chinatown and even outnumber Sunset Park's Chinese population, however they are more spread out and intermixed with still some existing Italian, Jewish, and Russian enclave clusters unlike Sunset Park's Chinese population that concentrate amongst each other. Sheepshead Bay's Chinese population, although significant is comparatively a lot smaller than Bensonhurst or Sunset Park and mainly concentrate around the Avenue U area. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/nyregion/influx-of-chinese- immigrants-is-reshaping-large-parts-of-brooklyn.html Approximately 19,851 Asian Indians live in Brooklyn. Approximately 9,681 Filipino Americans live in Brooklyn. Approximately 6,977 Korean Americans reside here. Brooklyn has the most Vietnamese Americans of any borough, they numbered over 5,700 individuals. The 4,704 Japanese Americans rounded out Asian American groups with over 1,000 people in Brooklyn. There is Pakistani American community in the Parkville section of Brooklyn and there is a \\"Little Pakistan\\" on Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn. Pakisatanis are concentrated heavily in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, and are one of the fastest growing Asian ethnic groups in Brooklyn . Pakistanis number around 30,000 and counting in Brooklyn and their community is growing rapidly. Many halal restaurants, fabric stores, Pakistani clothing stores and mosques are centered on Coney Island Avenue. Currently, the Brooklyn Asian enclaves are scattered and intertwined with the predominant European American communities in southern Brooklyn. ===Arab Americans=== Arab Americans currently reside in the western and southern central parts of Brooklyn, with a small population in eastern Brooklyn. Bay Ridge currently holds the highest percentage of Arab Americans, with its main thoroughfare being 5th avenue. Other neighborhoods include Boerum Hill, which historically held the largest Yemeni population, but now many Yemeni Americans have moved to Bay Ridge due to the increase of rent in Boerum Hill. Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, parts of Sunset Park, Dyker Heights Park Slope, and East New York also hold a large amount of Arab Americans.

The term standard model of arithmetic refers to the standard natural numbers 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶. The elements of any model of Peano arithmetic are linearly ordered and possess an initial segment isomorphic to the standard natural numbers. A non- standard model is one that has additional elements outside this initial segment. The construction of such models is due to Thoralf Skolem (1934). == Existence == There are several methods that can be used to prove the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic. === From the compactness theorem === The existence of non-standard models of arithmetic can be demonstrated by an application of the compactness theorem. To do this, a set of axioms P* is defined in a language including the language of Peano arithmetic together with a new constant symbol x. The axioms consist of the axioms of Peano arithmetic P together with another infinite set of axioms: for each numeral n, the axiom x > n is included. Any finite subset of these axioms is satisfied by a model that is the standard model of arithmetic plus the constant x interpreted as some number larger than any numeral mentioned in the finite subset of P*. Thus by the compactness theorem there is a model satisfying all the axioms P*. Since any model of P* is a model of P (since a model of a set of axioms is obviously also a model of any subset of that set of axioms), we have that our extended model is also a model of the Peano axioms. The element of this model corresponding to x cannot be a standard number, because as indicated it is larger than any standard number. Using more complex methods, it is possible to build non-standard models that possess more complicated properties. For example, there are models of Peano arithmetic in which Goodstein's theorem fails. It can be proved in Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory that Goodstein's theorem holds in the standard model, so a model where Goodstein's theorem fails must be non-standard. === From the incompleteness theorems === G√∂del's incompleteness theorems also imply the existence of non-standard models of arithmetic. The incompleteness theorems show that a particular sentence G, the G√∂del sentence of Peano arithmetic, is not provable nor disprovable in Peano arithmetic. By the completeness theorem, this means that G is false in some model of Peano arithmetic. However, G is true in the standard model of arithmetic, and therefore any model in which G is false must be a non-standard model. Thus satisfying ~G is a sufficient condition for a model to be nonstandard. It is not a necessary condition, however; for any G√∂del sentence G, there are models of arithmetic with G true of all cardinalities. Arithmetic unsoundness for models with ~G true Assuming that arithmetic is consistent, arithmetic with ~G is also consistent. However, since ~G means that arithmetic is inconsistent, the result will not be œâ-consistent (because ~G is false and this violates œâ-consistency). === From an ultraproduct === Another method for constructing a non-standard model of arithmetic is via an ultraproduct. A typical construction uses the set of all sequences of natural numbers, \\\\mathbb{N}^{\\\\mathbb{N}}. Identify two sequences if they agree almost everywhere. The resulting semiring is a non-standard model of arithmetic. It can be identified with the hypernatural numbers. == Structure of countable non-standard models == The ultraproduct models are uncountable. One way to see this is to construct an injection of the infinite product of N into the ultraproduct. However, by the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem there must exist countable non-standard models of arithmetic. One way to define such a model is to use Henkin semantics. Any countable non-standard model of arithmetic has order type , where œâ is the order type of the standard natural numbers, œâ* is the dual order (an infinite decreasing sequence) and Œ∑ is the order type of the rational numbers. In other words, a countable non- standard model begins with an infinite increasing sequence (the standard elements of the model). This is followed by a collection of \\"blocks,\\" each of order type , the order type of the integers. These blocks are in turn densely ordered with the order type of the rationals. The result follows fairly easily because it is easy to see that the blocks of non-standard numbers have to be dense and linearly ordered without endpoints, and the order type of the rationals is the only countable dense linear order without endpoints.Andrey Bovykin and Richard Kaye Order-types of models of Peano arithmetic: a short survey June 14, 2001Andrey Bovykin On order-types of models of arithmetic thesis submitted to the University of Birmingham for the degree of Ph.D. in the Faculty of Science 13 April 2000Fred Landman LINEAR ORDERS, DISCRETE, DENSE, AND CONTINUOUS ‚Äì includes proof that Q is the only countable dense linear order. So, the order type of the countable non-standard models is known. However, the arithmetical operations are much more complicated. It is easy to see that the arithmetical structure differs from . For instance if a nonstandard (non-finite) element u is in the model, then so is for any m, n in the initial segment N, yet u2 is larger than for any standard finite m. Also one can define \\"square roots\\" such as the least v such that . These cannot be within a standard finite number of any rational multiple of u. By analogous methods to non-standard analysis one can also use PA to define close approximations to irrational multiples of a non-standard number u such as the least v with (these can be defined in PA using non-standard finite rational approximations of even though pi itself cannot be). Once more, has to be larger than any standard finite number for any standard finite m, n. This shows that the arithmetical structure of a countable non-standard model is more complex than the structure of the rationals. There is more to it than that though. Tennenbaum's theorem shows that for any countable non-standard model of Peano arithmetic there is no way to code the elements of the model as (standard) natural numbers such that either the addition or multiplication operation of the model is a computable on the codes. This result was first obtained by Stanley Tennenbaum in 1959. == References  Citations = Sources === * Boolos, G., and Jeffrey, R. 1974.

Players assume the role of explorers who are after ancient jewels, which are guarded by an angry spirit. Occasionally, the bridge guard will awaken and (via a motorized mechanism powered by the player pushing his head down) shake the bridge, which can cause players' pieces to fall off.

The glyphs are: A stick figure, a jewel, a stick figure with the jewel as its body, lightning, and a skull. The glyphs are supposed to be a warning to those wishing to take jewels; the stick figure is the explorer, the figure with the jewel as its body is the explorer having taken a jewel, the lightning represents the Idol's anger, and the skull represents the resulting death or injury. ==References * Category:Board games introduced in 1992 Category:Milton Bradley Company games Category:Adventure board games Category:Roll-and-move board games ","title":"Forbidden Bridge"},{"id":"6251461","text":"Hill River may refer to: * Hill River (Western Australia), river and town * Hill River (Lost River), a river in Minnesota * Hill River (Willow River), a river in Minnesota * Hill River State Forest, a state forest in Minnesota *Hill River, South Australia, a locality *Hill River (South Australia), a river * Hill River Township, Minnesota, town == See also == * Eagle Hill River * Little Hill River * Polish Hill River * Red Hill River * Sand Hill River * Smoky Hill River * Woodford Hill River * North Fork Smoky Hill River ","title":"Hill River"},{"id":"6251482","text":"Darryn Lyons (born 19 August 1965) is an Australian media personality, entrepreneur and politician, who rose to prominence in Australia and the United Kingdom as a paparazzo. He held the position of Mayor of Geelong from 2013 to 2016. ==Early life== Born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia on 19 August 1965, Lyons grew up the youngest of three children in the suburb of Herne Hill, and later Leopold. His father was an architect and the choirmaster of the Aberdeen Street Baptist Church, and designed the family's \\"cathedral-like\\" house. Lyons's passion for photography started at a young age, and he attended Geelong East Technical School, where he was regularly dux of school. ==Photography career== After completing his schooling, Lyons began work as a professional photographer at the Geelong News and Geelong Advertiser. At the age of 22, he moved to London, where he gained a job at the News of the World after a chance meeting with Rupert Murdoch. Two years later, he left to take a position with the Daily Mail, for whom he provided coverage of the Bosnian War. In 1993, Lyons founded the picture company Big Pictures, which supplied paparazzi-style photography for news organisations. Big Pictures was run by his wife Melanie Lyons and Kevin Anstey, while Lyons worked as a photographer for the Daily Mail newspaper. During 1996, Darryn Lyons left the Daily Mail to work full-time at Big Pictures alongside Melanie Lyons. He gained widespread media attention when his company sold a photograph to the News of the World, which was used to support a claim that football star David Beckham was having an affair with his personal assistant Rebecca Loos.\\" On the night of the fatal car crash involving Princess Diana in 1997, Big Pictures received photographs from its Paris agent Laurent Sola of Diana's final moments. Lyons still own these photos which have never been published, and has stated that he never would sell them. Lyons gave evidence at the 2007 inquest into Diana's death. The company often faced legal action relating to invasion of privacy and harassment, from celebrities including Sienna Miller, Lily Allen, JK Rowling, Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley. Big Pictures also ran a Mr Paparazzi website and YouTube channel from 2007 to 2013, featuring celebrity news, photos and videos In 2012, Big Pictures was placed into administration after facing financial difficulties, with all staff members of the company being made redundant. Lyons subsequently established the Mr Paparazzi Celebrity Deals company and became a shareholder of another firm called BPGG Limited, facilitating the purchase of Big Pictures' assets for ¬£164,000.https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/darryn-lyons-buys-big-pictures-assets- for-164k/ Big Pictures went into liquidation in 2013, owing more than ¬£82,000 to photographers and picture agencies. In 2013, Lyons announced plans to launch an online celebrity stock photographic agency called Celebstock, however these plans did not eventuate. ==Media personality== Lyons has frequently appeared on radio and television programmes, including the Sky News Sunrise programme, LK Today, Australian radio shows Kyle and Jackie O Show and Hughsey and Kate, and a role as a weekly commentator on ITV1's Alan Titchmarsh Show. Lyons has also written for the Geelong Advertiser newspaper and NW magazine. He was one of the five venture capitalists on the 2005 Australian version of the reality television programme Dragons' Den, which ended after one season after poor ratings. In 2007, Lyons appeared on the British reality television shows Tycoon, and Deadline, as a picture editor and camera instructor. Lyons also appeared on the British panel show Through the Keyhole. In 2011, he appeared in the British Top Gear television show, representing Australia in a double-decker car race in the theme of The Ashes. He also became a housemate in the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5, entering the house in August 2011. Within a few days of entering the Big Brother house, Lyons unveiled his cosmetic \\"six-pack\\", which caused a high volume of media coverage for being a \\"sculpted six pack seemingly implanted atop his generous gut\\". He eventually finished in sixth place. In 2012, Lyons was a contestant in the Australian show Excess Baggage. The show was transferred to digital channel GO! shortly after its premiere due to poor ratings. Following the show's completion, it was deemed a failure, with numerous people identifying the contestants as the reason for the lack of success. ==Mayor of Geelong== In 2013, Lyons announced his candidacy for the City of Greater Geelong 2013 mayoral election. At the start of the election he was quoted as saying \\"As I have learnt from my time in the UK every election needs a comedy candidate and also as I've seen from Tony Abbott's example the electorate respects a man with great abs\\". Despite this he then campaigned heavily for the position with a \\"presidential-style mayoral campaign\\", including having a plane tow a banner across the sky in the city. He was declared elected after the distribution of preferences on 25 November 2013; Lyons garnered almost 30 per cent of the first preference votes, more than double the primary votes than the second-placed candidate. Lyons was sworn into office on 26 November 2013. As mayor, Lyons has focussed on lobbying for the city, creating publicity and lifting the city's profile in order to attract tourism and investment. Lyons has advocated for building a cruise ship pier on the Geelong waterfront in order to boost the city's economy with tourism. The pier would also incorporate a convention centre and cultural centre. Other initiatives introduced by Lyons include improving the city centre by making street parking free on weekends and planting plants in the streets. On 16 April 2016, the Victorian Government dismissed Lyons along with the rest of the Greater Geelong City Council, following a Commission of Inquiry which found that the council is riven with conflict, unable to manage Geelong's economic challenges, has dysfunctional leadership and has a culture of bullying. The government appointed administrators to run the council until council elections were held on 27 October 2017. Lyons ran as an Independent candidate in the 2018 Victorian state election but was unsuccessful. ==Personal life== Lyons resides in the Western Beach area of Geelong. His fianc√©e is Elissa Friday, a former model and a student. He was formerly married to Melanie Whitehead, who left him in 2000. Lyons is a personal friend of former Melbourne mayor Robert Doyle, who supported Lyons during his 2013 electoral campaign. Lyons has acknowledged drug abuse, binge drinking and heavy gambling during his life abroad. ==ReferencesCategory:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Australian expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Australian photographers Category:Mayors of Geelong Category:People from Geelong ","title":"Darryn Lyons"},{"id":"6251492","text":"Pefloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.

He attended Saint Macartan's College secondary school and then university. In 1982 he received a First Class Honours B.A. in History and Geography from National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Toal obtained an M.A. in Geography from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1984 and a Ph.D. in Political Geography from Syracuse University in 1989. John O'Loughlin in Illinois and John A. Agnew in Syracuse, were his academic advisors. Following his PhD, Toal became Assistant Professor of Geography at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, where he worked for ten years before moving to the Washington, D.C. region to establish the Government and International Affairs program in the School of Public and International Affairs. Toal‚Äôs research specializations include critical geopolitics, nationalism, political geography, post-Communism, globalization, territorial disputes, and discourse analysis. He has published on various field research projects in Bosnia- Herzegovina, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine. Toal has been a key figure in establishing Critical Geopolitics as a domain of research within Political Geography. He is one of the contemporary geographers featured in the book Key Thinkers in Space and Place. He has authored, co-authored and/or edited eight books. His book Bosnia Remade: Ethnic Cleansing and Its Reversal, co-authored with Dr Carl Dahlman (professor of geography at Miami University in Ohio), won the Julian Minghi Book Prize from the Political Geography Specialty Group. It examines how wartime ethnic cleansing and a post-war displaced person returns process transformed the character of three towns in Bosnia. Toal's book Near Abroad: Putin, the West, and the Contest over Ukraine and the Caucasus (Oxford University Press, 2017) won the ENMISA Distinguished Book Award from the International Studies Association in 2019. He is currently working on a book entitled Oceans Rise, Empires Fall that presents a critical framework for analyzing geopolitics amidst a deepening planetary climate emergency. Together with longtime collaborator Dr John O'Loughlin, and new collaborators Dr Kristin Bakke and Dr Marlene Laruelle, Toal also currently researches the geopolitical orientations of ordinary citizens in the borderland states of the Russian Federation. This work is funded by the US National Science Foundation and the Research Council of the United Kingdom. Early results from this research project have been published in various outlets, mostly in the Monkey Cage blog on The Washington Post website. One article on public opinion in Crimea six years after annexation in Foreign Affairs generated a response from the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

He played in the 2004 FA Cup Final were Millwall lost 3‚Äì0 to Manchester United. He joined Stoke City in the summer of 2005 for a fee of ¬£250,000 but his start at Stoke was hampered by injuries. He struggled to fully recover and after spending time out on loan at Yeovil Town and Walsall he joined Leeds United in January 2008. After a brief spell at Elland Road Sweeney played for Grimsby Town, Bury, AFC Wimbledon, Dartford and Greenwich Borough. ==CareerMillwall=== Sweeney was born in Glasgow and moved with his family to London when he was three-years-old. He started his career at Millwall, where he made his debut in 2002, but he had to wait another year for his breakthrough. Sweeney played 34 times for Millwall in 2003‚Äì04 and he played a major role in the Lions' route to the 2004 FA Cup Final, where he started against Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium, Millwall lost 3‚Äì0. Following the cup final appearance, Millwall received a place in the UEFA Cup for the 2004‚Äì05 season, in which Sweeney played a part in the first round of the tournament, where they were defeated by Hungarian side Ferencv√°rosi. ===Stoke City=== On 1 July 2005 Sweeney signed for Stoke City for a fee of ¬£250,000. His start at Stoke was hampered after he injured his back in a pre-season match against Newcastle Town, which ruled him out for the first three months of the 2005‚Äì06. Once he recovered from his injury Sweeney went on to play 20 times scoring once on the final day of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion. He scored against Luton Town in a 2‚Äì2 draw early in the 2006‚Äì07 season but soon lost his place in the side and joined Yeovil Town on loan in January 2007. He played eight times for the Golvers before returning to Stoke in April 2007. On 22 November 2007 he signed a two-month loan deal at Walsall where he made seven appearances. ===Leeds United=== Early in the January 2008 transfer window Stoke accepted an undisclosed bid for the midfielder from Leeds United, with whom he swiftly agreed personally terms, and it was announced that he would sign, subject to a medical the following week. He finalised the move on 10 January, joining the club on a two‚Äìand‚Äìa‚Äìhalf‚Äìyear deal. Despite starting in the last few games of Dennis Wise reign as Leeds manager, including making his debut away to Crewe and providing the assist for Jermaine Beckford's winning header, Sweeney failed to establish himself under managers Gary McAllister and Simon Grayson. ===Grimsby Town=== Sweeney made a loan move in March 2009 to Grimsby Town, signing with Grimsby until the end of the season, along with Bradford City forward Barry Conlon and fellow Leeds player Jonathan Lund. Sweeney went on to be part of a Grimsby side that would make a late surge in the league, and that would eventually stave off the threat of relegation from the Football League. Following the close of the 2008‚Äì2009 season and the end of his loan spell, he was released from his contract at Leeds, following a one and a half year spell at the Yorkshire club. On 3 July 2009, after much speculation, Sweeney re‚Äìsigned for \\"The Mariners\\", on a two‚Äìyear deal.Sweeney Deal Done , Grimsby Town F.C., 3 July 2009. Retrieved 13 July 2009 He scored his first goal for the club against Rotherham United in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home. Sweeney then managed to score a superb volley against his former club Leeds, in the third round of the Football League Trophy at Elland Road. A corner resulted in Leeds keeper Casper Ankergren punching the ball out too Sweeney, who smashed in a left foot volley from the edge of the area, that crashed in off the under side of the cross bar. However Grimsby went on to lose the game 3‚Äì1. On 18 December, Sweeney scored another spectacular goal after hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with Morecambe. Sweeney continued to hold down a position in the centre of midfield throughout the 09/10 season. On 12 May 2010, Sweeney was one of seven players placed on the transfer list by Grimsby manager Neil Woods after their relegation from the football league. ===Bury=== Sweeney joined Bury on 25 June 2010 signing a two‚Äìyear deal. Despite failing to hold down a regular starting place for \\"The Shakers\\" during the 2010‚Äì11 season, Sweeney performed consistently when called upon by manager Alan Knill. Following Knill's departure, Sweeney entered the fold under Richie Barker following suspensions and injuries to regular midfield duo Damien Mozika and Steven Schumacher eventually helping the club to earn promotion from League Two. Sweeney made 41 appearances in League One, scoring 4 goals during the 2011‚Äì12 season and made 21 appearances, scoring 1 goal, in all competitions during the 2012‚Äì13 season for Bury before being sold to AFC Wimbledon on 8 January 2013. During his time at Bury, Sweeney made a total of 95 appearances, which is the most games he has ever played for one club. ===AFC Wimbledon=== On 8 January 2013 Sweeney signed for League Two side AFC Wimbledon for a free transfer. After only seven appearances for \\"The Dons\\", Sweeney suffered a broken foot in a game against Northampton Town on 19 February 2013 at The Cherry Red Records Stadium. The injury put him out of action for the remainder of the 2012‚Äì2013 season. He returned during AFC Wimbledon's 2013‚Äì2014 pre‚Äìseason campaign, scoring in a behind closed doors game against Gillingham on 2 July 2013 that ended 2‚Äì1 to \\"The Gills\\". Sweeney came on as a substitute for Harry Pell in AFC Wimbledon's next friendly game against Dartford on 6 July 2013 at Princes Park, the game ended 2‚Äì2. ===Dartford=== In August 2014, he signed for Conference Premier side Dartford on a one-year contract. In May 2015, Sweeney was released by the club following relegation to the National League South and the expiration of his contract. ===Later career=== Following his release from Dartford Sweeney joined Greenwich Borough in June 2015. In October 2017, Sweeney moved to Glebe as to take on the role of assistant manager, working with Anwar Uddin. He was appointed manager in January 2019,Peter Sweeney installed as Glebe's new manager, while Steve O'Boyle and Steve Sallis joint-manage Greenwich Borough Kentish Football, 28 January 2019 but resigned in September the same year.Glebe begin the search for a new manager as Peter Sweeney steps down after only 23 games in charge Kentish Football, 2 September 2019 ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Club statistics - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Millwall 2001‚Äì02 First Division 1000000010 - 2002‚Äì03 First Division 511000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî61 - 2003‚Äì04 First Division 2925000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî342 - 2004‚Äì05 Championship 24210001Appearance in UEFA Cup0262 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !59!!5!!7!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!67!!5 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Stoke City 2005‚Äì06 Championship 1713000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî201 - 2006‚Äì07 Championship 1311010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî151 - 2007‚Äì08 Championship 500010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî60 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !35!!2!!4!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî!!41!!2 - Yeovil Town (loan) 2006‚Äì07 League One 8000000080 - Walsall (loan) 2007‚Äì08 League One 7000000070 - Leeds United 2007‚Äì08 League One 9000000090 - Grimsby Town (loan) 2008‚Äì09 League Two 8000000080 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Grimsby Town 2009‚Äì10 League Two 40400102Appearance(s) in Football League Trophy2436 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !48!!4!!0!!0!!1!!0!!2!!2!!51!!6 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Bury 2010‚Äì11 League Two 250101020290 - 2011‚Äì12 League One 414102010454 - 2012‚Äì13 League One 161301010211 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !82!!5!!5!!0!!4!!0!!4!!0!!95!!5 - rowspan=\\"3\\"AFC Wimbledon 2012‚Äì13 League Two 7000000070 - 2013‚Äì14 League Two 220101011251 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !29!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!1!!1!!32!!1 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Dartford 2014‚Äì15 Conference Premier 36130colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî3Appearances in FA Trophy0421 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !313!!17!!20!!0!!8!!0!!11!!3!!352!!20 } ==Honours== ; Millwall * FA Cup runner‚Äìup: 2004 ; Stoke City * Football League Championship runner‚Äìup: 2007‚Äì08 ; Bury * Football League Two runner‚Äìup: 2010‚Äì11 ==References * *Scotland U21 profile at Fitbastats *Scotland B profile at Fitbastats Category:1984 births Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Living people Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Scotland B international footballers Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Yeovil Town F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:AFC Wimbledon players Category:Dartford F.C. players Category:Greenwich Borough F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Glebe F.C. managers Category:Scottish football managers Category:Footballers from Greater London Category:Anglo-Scots ","title":"Peter Sweeney"},{"id":"6251516","text":" German submarine U-555 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.

Some examples of these alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. The complexity of the rules for self-directed IRA's prompted the SEC to issue a public notice in 2011 against an increased risk of fraud. In 2019, the maximum self-directed IRA and self-directed Roth IRA contribution is $6,000 or $7,000 if over the age of 50. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations require that a qualified trustee, or custodian, hold IRA assets on behalf of the IRA owner. The trustee/custodian provides custody of the assets, processes all transactions, maintains other records pertaining to them, files required IRS reports, issues client statements, helps clients understand the rules and regulations pertaining to certain prohibited transactions, and performs other administrative duties on behalf of the self- directed IRA owner. The account owner for all IRAs chooses among the investment options allowed by the IRA custodian. For regular IRAs these options usually include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, but with a self- directed IRA, the term \\"self-directed\\" refers to the significantly broader range of alternative investments available to the account owner. IRA custodians are allowed to restrict the types of assets they will handle in addition to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) restrictions. ==Checkbook control== Checkbook Control, sometimes called ‚ÄùAlternative IRA,‚Äù ‚ÄúSelf-Managed IRA,‚Äù ‚ÄúIRA LLC,‚Äù ‚ÄúReal Estate IRA,‚Äù or a ‚ÄúCheckbook IRA.‚Äù Checkbook Control is one of the strategies of self-directed IRA, where the owner can decide and invest its retirement funds in real estate, private loans, startup crowdfundings, precious metals like gold, cryptocurrency, and others, unlike with traditional custodians where the person usually limited only to the stock market. To achieve this strategy, a business LLC is established, and a checking account is opened. A custodian is then instructed to invest the IRA into the newly formed LLC (known as ‚Äùcapitalization‚Äù). Essentially, they use the IRA funds to purchase the new LLC as an alternative asset investment on the investor‚Äôs behalf. It‚Äôs the only investment that will go through the custodian. Finally, the custodian sends you a capitalization check to the LLC‚Äôs checking account. After that, the investor has an IRA LLC with Checkbook Control, and manages the LLC, so that the investor gain flexibility in investments and can buy assets not available through regular brokerage accounts. Custodian used in this scenario only to fund in the LLC, therefore typically does not have any transaction fee, but has fixed one-time establishment fee and fixed maintenance fee. There are classes of prohibited assets: collectibles (like baseball cards, stamps, and art), life insurance contracts. And in addition to prohibited assets, there is also a list of prohibited transactions and disqualified persons. In short, the investor cannot invest it's retirement savings to provide a loan to themselves, immediate family, or investment advisors. The investor cannot withdraw savings from their LLC or buy anything of value: purchase that benefits themselves or their relatives is considered a withdrawal from the retirement account and is subject to taxes and penalties because the tax-exempt money intended to be used only for investments for future retirement. ==Prohibited asset types== Internal Revenue Code Section 408 prohibits IRA investments in life insurance and in collectibles such as artwork, rugs, antiques, metals (there are exceptions for certain kinds of bullion), gems, stamps, coins (there are exceptions for certain coins minted by the U.S. Treasury), alcoholic beverages, and certain other tangible personal property. ==Prohibited transactions== IRS regulations prohibit transactions that are an improper use of the value in the account or annuity by the account owner, the account owner's beneficiary, or any other disqualified persons, as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 4975. In essence, IRA prohibited transactions are transactions that Congress has deemed inappropriate between IRAs and certain people associated with those IRAs. The IRS prohibited-transaction rules apply to all individual retirement accounts, such as traditional IRA and Roth IRA as well as SEP plans and SIMPLE IRA plans. These rules are generally designed to prevent self-dealing or conflict- of-interest transactions, which are transactions that directly or indirectly benefit the IRA holder or a disqualified person, and not the IRA or plan. Disqualified persons include the IRA holder, a fiduciary (e.g., the IRA holder or plan participant) and members of the IRA holder's family, such as the spouse, ancestor, lineal descendant (e.g., children), any spouse of a lineal descendant, and persons similarly financially related to the IRA holder. The self-dealing and conflict-of-interest types of prohibited transactions, as outlined in IRC sections 4975(c)(1)(D) and 4975(c)(1)(E), are the broadest and most complex categories of prohibited transaction. To trigger a self-dealing or conflict of interest transaction, the IRS simply has to show that a disqualified person received some direct or indirect personal benefit. If the account owner or beneficiary engaged in a prohibited transaction, the account is treated as distributing all its assets to the IRA holder at their fair market values on the first day of the year in which the transaction occurred. The distribution would be subject to any taxes or penalties associated with an early distribution: generally, a 10% early withdrawal penalty and treatment of the distribution as ordinary income for the purposes of income taxes. ==Permitted investments== The Internal Revenue Code does not describe what a self-directed IRA can invest in, only what it cannot invest in. Internal Revenue Code Sections 408 and 4975 prohibit Disqualified Persons from engaging in certain types of transactions. Some of the investment options permitted under the regulations include real estate, stocks, mortgages, franchises, partnerships, precious metals, private equity, cryptocurrencies and tax liens. While the type of investment allowed in an IRA is broadly defined, the SEC has issued an investor alert explaining why using this type of IRA might present increased risk of fraud. Business investments may include partnerships, joint ventures, and private stock. This can be a platform to fund a start-up business or other for-profit venture that is managed by someone other than the account owner of the IRA. However, using a self-directed IRA to invest in an active trade or business via a pass-through entity such as an LLC or partnership can trigger a tax as the income generated would be treated as Unrelated Business Income, subject to the Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT). A self-directed IRA can hold precious metals, which are typically held by a third-party custodian. The regulations pertaining to investing in precious metals are in Section 408(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Some US government minted coins (American Eagles and American Buffalo) are permissible. Bullion is also permissible if it meets a standard level of fineness, and is produced by a COMEX or NYMEX approved refiner. In order for coins to be held inside an IRA, coins must satisfy a certain level of pureness in their mineral content so that they are not viewed as a type of collector's coin. As a result, Double Eagle gold coins (minted in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) and South African Krugerrands are disallowed because they do not meet this standard. An IRA can purchase any type of real estate as long as the provider (aka custodian) of that IRA handles real estate. IRA providers that handle real estate are often called self-directed IRA providers. If the IRA does not have enough cash to pay the full purchase price, then the IRA can partner with a person, company/entity or another IRA, or it can secure a non-recourse loan to buy real estate. Whether the IRA is whole or part owner, IRA funds are used for purchase, maintenance, and expenses. When the property generates cash either with rental income or from sale, those funds go directly back to the IRA. The IRS prohibits certain actions. For example, neither the IRA holder nor any disqualified persons to that plan may live in or vacation in the property. The IRA holder makes the decisions about how the asset is maintained but cannot do the work themselves. IRA funds are allowed to be invested in private companies. The IRA ownership of private equity is usually expressed as a percentage of ownership in the company or as a number of shares of stock. The IRS puts restrictions on private equity investments that can be made by an IRA. It cannot purchase stock that the IRA holder already owns. Earnings from the entity may be subject to UBIT if the company has earnings from debt or has earnings from the sale of products or services. In most cases, neither the IRA holder nor any disqualified persons to the plan can be employed by the company while the IRA has an equity position in that company. The IRA cannot be a general partner in a LP or LLP, and it cannot invest in an S-corporation. Unlike prohibited transactions that are rules governing IRAs, the restriction on IRA investment in an S-corporation is an S-corp rule. An entity is not eligible for Subchapter S taxation if it has IRA shareholdersIRA Investment in S-Corporations - www.401kCheckbook.com. Retrieved 2017-4-26. and its S-corp election is terminated if an IRA becomes a shareholder. The IRS allows IRAs and other retirement accounts to make loans. The IRA holder assumes the responsibility of choosing the borrower, the principal amount and interest rate, length of the term, payment frequency and amount of the loan. The holder also negotiates whether or not the note will be secured. Other self-directed IRA investments are often chosen by the IRA holder's expertise in a certain area of investing. The self-directed IRA is very popular with retirement investors looking to invest in real estate and cryptocurrency investments because of the need to be more involved in the process and still keep custodian fees low. ==See also== *403(b) *Comparison of 401(k) and IRA accounts *Roth 401(k) *Rollovers as Business Start-Ups *Self-invested personal pension in the United Kingdom ==References *IRS Publication 590 (2005), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) *Self Directed IRA Basics, Facts & Rules ","title":"Self-directed IRA"},{"id":"6251526","text":"Hillyard may refer to: *Hillyard, Spokane, Washington, a neighborhood in Spokane Washington *Hillyard Township, Macoupin County, Illinois *Hillyard, Inc., specialist in maintenance of basketball courts *Hillyard Cabin, cabin in Randolph County, Arkansas on National Register of Historic Places ==People with the surname== *Blanche Bingley Hillyard (1863‚Äì1946), English tennis player *Dave Hillyard, American musician *George Hillyard (1864‚Äì1943), English tennis player *Lyle W.

The marketing authorization of cinoxacin has been suspended throughout the EU. Cinoxacin was an older synthetic antimicrobial related to the quinolone class of antibiotics with activity similar to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. It was commonly used thirty years ago to treat urinary tract infections in adults. There are reports that cinoxacin had also been used to treat initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in dogs.Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary 3rd Edition, by D.C. Blood, V.P. Studdert and C.C. Gay, Elsevier however this veterinary use was never approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Urologische Abteilung, St. Elisabeth-Krankenhaus K√∂ln-Hohenlind. ==History== Cinoxacin is one of the original quinolone drugs, which were introduced in the 1970s. Commonly referred to as the first generation quinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs such as pipemidic acid, and oxolinic acid, but this first generation proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid. Cinoxacin is similar chemically (and in antimicrobial activity) to oxolonic acid and nalidixic acid. Relative to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin was found to have a slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity. Cinoxacin was patented in 1972 and assigned to Eli Lilly.Pharmaceutical manufacturing encyclopedia, Volume 2 By Marshall Sittig see page 346 Eli Lilly obtained approval from the FDA to market cinoxacin in the United States as Cinobac on June 13, 1980. Prior to this cinobac was marketed in the U.K. and Switzerland in 1979. Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) commenced sales of Cinobac in the United States and Canada back in September 1992, under an agreement with Eli Lilly which granted Oclassen exclusive United States and Canadian distribution rights. Oclassen promoted Cinobac primarily to urologists for the outpatient treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and prophylaxis. Oclassen Pharmaceuticals was a privately held pharmaceutical company founded in 1985 until acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in 1997. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (also incorporated in 1985), having acquired Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) also acquired the marketing rights contained within the agreement with Eli Lilly to market Cinobac.http://www.getfilings.com/o0001016843-98-000129.html ==Licensed uses== Urinary tract infections only ==Availability== 250 mg, capsules (prescription only) ==Mode of action== Cinoxacin mode of action involves the inhibiting of DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. ==Contraindications== Within the most recent package insert (circa 1999) Cinobac is listed as being contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cinoxacin or other quinolones. ==Adverse reactions== The safety profile of cinoxacin appears to be rather unremarkable. Adverse drug reactions appear to be limited to the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system.A comparison of cinoxacin and nalidixic acid in the treatment of chronic urinary tract infections [Article in German] Briedigkeit H, Schimmelpfennig R, Buder R, Precht K, Dr√∂seler H.

As a result of this safety profile the manufacturer, Eli Lilley states that \\"cinoxacin perhaps should be reserved only for those patients with organisms resistant to usual first-line agents or those who fail to respond to therapy with these agents.\\"Drug Intell Clin Pharm. 1982 Dec;16(12):916-21.Cinoxacin (Cinobac, Eli Lilly & Co.). Guay DR. ==Overdose== Symptoms following an overdose of cinoxacin may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea. The severity of the epigastric distress and the diarrhea are dose related. Patients who have ingested an overdose of cinoxacin should be kept well hydrated to prevent crystalluria. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of cinoxacin.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/18067s29lbl.pdf ==Pharmacokinetics== Biotransformation is mainly hepatic, with approximately 30-40% metabolized to inactive metabolites.

It is located in the West of the Fricktal region, around four kilometers Southwest of the border with Germany and has a border with Canton Basel-Landschaft. Aerial view (1950) ==Geography== The village lies in the upper reaches of the M√∂hlin valley (M√∂hlintal) through which flows the M√∂hlinbach in a Northwesterly direction towards the Rhine. There are two parts to the village: The lower village (Unterdorf) lies parallel to the M√∂hlinbach for over one kilometer; The upper village (Oberdorf) lies on the West side of the valley. The flat valley floor alongside the M√∂hlinbach is, on average, close to 200 meters wide but widens to almost 400 meters when joined by feeder streams. The village is bordered on both sides by the hills of the Tabel Jura (Tafeljura) which have very steep lower slopes leading to flat upper plateau's that are intensively farmed. To the east of the village rises the Wabrig plateau which is over one kilometer wide and stretches for more than four kilometers between the Lohnberg plateau (above Zuzgen) and the Hersberg (above Wegenstetten). A deeply cut side valley runs in a Westerly direction from the village, separating the Northern Neulig plateau from the Southern Egg plateau. Hellikon has an area, , of . Of this area, or 60.9% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 32.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 6.5% is settled (buildings or roads).Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 3.7% and transportation infrastructure made up 2.1%. Out of the forested land, 30.9% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.7% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 37.0% is used for growing crops and 21.3% is pastures, while 2.6% is used for orchards or vine crops. The highest point is found on the west side of the Neulig plateau () and the lowest at the M√∂hlinbach (). Neighbouring villages in Kanton Aargau are Zuzgen to the Northwest, Obermumpf to the Northeast, Schupfart to the East and Wegenstetten to the Southeast. Neighbouring villages in Canton Baselland are Buus to the West and Hemmiken to the Southwest. ==History== The first documented mention of Hellickonn dates from 1209.Bernhard Brogli et al: Hellikon 1209‚Äì2009 Rheinfelden 2009. The low jurisdiction was in the possession of the Hofes Zeiningen, which in turn were affiliated to the Stift S√§ckingen. The gentry and tenants of the \\"upper jurisdiction\\" were Habsburgers. After the Waldshut war of 1468 the whole Fricktal was pledged to the Duchy of Burgundy. The Burgundians were crushingly defeated by the Old Swiss Confederacy during the Burgundian Wars meaning that Hellikon was restored to Austrian (Habsburg) authority by 1477. Following the country reforms of the Austrian King Maximilian I. Hellikon fell under the authority of \\"Further Austria\\" in 1491. The M√∂hlinbach territory (including Hellikon) came under the administration of the Kameralherrschaft Rheinfelden. During the 17th century, there was very little time when peace prevailed. During the Rappenkrieg, a peasant uprising that lasted from 1612 until 1614 and the Thirty Years' War (1633 to 1638) the villages economic development went into decline. Also during the Pf√§lzer-Erbfolge Wars (1688 to 1697) foreign troops passed through the region. As a result of the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the Fricktal became a French protectorate, forming the front line between the French Revolutionary and the Austrian troops in the War of the Second Coalition. On 20 February 1802 Rheinfelden was made a district capital of the newly created Canton of Fricktal, (Principality of Frickgau), joining the Helvetic Republic in August. On 19 February 1803 Canton Fricktal, including Hellikon, was absorbed into Canton Aargau. At the 1875 Christmas Fair a tragic accident occurred. The stairwell of the ten-year-old school house collapsed, killing 73 people of whom most were children. Between 1850 and 1950 the village population dropped by over twenty percent. Up to the 20th century cereals and grapes contributed the main income, however the phylloxera plague and mildew epidemics effectively ended grape farming in the village. Hellikon transformed from a farming to a commuter community with ever more people moving from the Basel region. Since the beginning of the 1980s the population has grown by almost one third. In August 2009, Hellikon celebrated its 800th anniversary with a large village fair. ==Flag== The blazon of the municipal flags describes \\"Over blue, a green triple hill and three yellow morels\\". The flag was officially adopted in 1924 but it was known much earlier, although never documented.

It starred Charles Laughton as a ghost doomed to haunt an English castle and Robert Young as his American relative called upon to perform an act of bravery to redeem him.Variety film review; May 31, 1944, page 20.Harrison's Reports film review; June 3, 1944, page 90. It was remade as a TV movie of the same title in 1986 and again in 1996. ==Plot== In the seventeenth century, Sir Simon de Canterville (Charles Laughton) is forced by the Code of Chivalry to engage in a duel on behalf of his brother, but flees to the family castle when his opponent engages a substitute‚Äîa giant, the Bold Sir Guy (played by an uncredited Tor Johnson). His proud father, Lord Canterville (Reginald Owen), refuses to acknowledge that his son has disgraced the family name, even when shown in front of witnesses where Simon is cowering. The father has the only entrance to his son's hiding place bricked over as proof that Simon is not there, ignoring Simon's pleas for mercy. Lord Canterville then curses his doomed cowardly son to find no rest until \\"a kinsman shall perform an act of bravery\\" in his name, wearing his signet ring. Next, during World War II, US Army Rangers are billeted in the castle, owned now by six-year-old Lady Jessica de Canterville (Margaret O'Brien). One of the men is Cuffy Williams (Robert Young). The Rangers encounter Sir Simon but rather than being terrorized, they humiliate the ghost with a mock haunting. With Cuffy's help, Jessica overcomes her own terror of the ghost. Jessica discovers that Cuffy is a Canterville by a distinctive birthmark on his neck. He is a descendant of Sir Simon‚Äôs brother. Together, the two meet Sir Simon and learn the fate of their ghostly ancestor. One night, Simon takes Cuffy on a tour of the family portrait gallery, recounting the cowardly act of each descendant. Cuffy scoffs at Simon's misgivings and boasts that he is different. However, when the moment of crisis comes, Cuffy seems to be a true Canterville and is paralyzed by fear in combat. On a mission in Europe, he and another soldier are stationed with a machine gun to ambush a large group of Nazi soldiers on motorcycles. Sir Simon appears with the signet ring, which Cuffy had left behind, and his attempts to encourage Cuffy make the young man even more apprehensive. The Nazi convoy appears on the road. His buddy fires and Cuffy feeds the ammunition belt. All seems well until his partner is shot by a sniper. Cuffy moves to take his place, with his friend‚Äôs blood on his hand and bullets pinging around him. He freezes, staring, unable to pull the trigger. Another soldier knocks him aside and takes over. Back in England, Cuffy reports himself. Disgraced and leaving the Rangers for his old outfit, Cuffy is left alone at the castle while the others go out on maneuvers on the huge estate. He is given another chance when Lady Jessica runs to tell him that she saw a parachute land in the woods. She shows him how to drive there. It is an unexploded parachute mine, a blockbuster threatening his platoon and everyone within half a mile with destruction. He springs into action, positioning the jeep to drag the mine to a nearby ravine, but as he hooks the chain to the mine, he is again overcome with fear. Lady Jessica tries to inspire him by kicking the mine frantically, calling ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid.‚Äù She inadvertently activates the mine. Cuffy recovers, hitches the bomb to the jeep and, after a wild ride with Sir Simon aboard, steers it into the ravine, where it explodes. The courageous act finally frees Sir Simon from his centuries of bondage, and he can sleep at last in the garden. Lady Jessica and Cuffy lay flowers at Sir Simon‚Äôs tombstone (1603-1943). A long time to wait, Cuffy observes. Speaking of waiting, Lady Jessica asks Cuffy how old he is. He doesn‚Äôt answer but asks Why? ‚Äú I shall be 7 in May, ‚Äú Jessica replies, shyly. He picks her up and they both laugh. ==Cast== * Charles Laughton as Sir Simon de Canterville * Robert Young as Cuffy Williams * Margaret O'Brien as Lady Jessica de Canterville * William Gargan as Sergeant Benson * Reginald Owen as Lord Canterville * Rags Ragland as Big Harry * Una O'Connor as Mrs. Umney * Donald Stuart as Sir Valentine Williams * Elisabeth Risdon as Mrs. Polverdine * Frank Faylen as Lieutenant Kane * Lumsden Hare as Mr. Potts * Mike Mazurki as Metropolus * William Moss as Hector * Bobby Readick as Eddie * Marc Cramer as Bugsy McDougle * William Tannen as Jordan * Peter Lawford as Anthony de Canterville * Vernon Downing as Officer * Tor Johnson as the Bold Sir Guy ==Production== The motion picture was shot at Busch Gardens in Pasadena, California.

It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, and the role of literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure. Print edition only. Bechdel later traced her maternal relationship in Are You My Mother?: A Comic Drama. Fun Home has been the subject of numerous academic publications in areas such as biography studies and cultural studies as part of a larger turn towards serious academic investment in the study of comics/sequential art.e.g. Tolmie, Jane (2009). \\"Modernism, Memory and Desire: Queer Cultural Production in Alison Bechdel's Fun Home.\\" Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies. 22: 77-96; Fun Home has been both a popular and critical success, and spent two weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. In The New York Times Sunday Book Review, Sean Wilsey called it \\"a pioneering work, pushing two genres (comics and memoir) in multiple new directions.\\" Several publications named Fun Home as one of the best books of 2006; it was also included in several lists of the best books of the 2000s. It was nominated for several awards, including the National Book Critics Circle Award and three Eisner Awards (one of which it won). A French translation of Fun Home was serialized in the newspaper Lib√©ration; the book was an official selection of the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival and has been the subject of an academic conference in France. Fun Home also generated controversy, being challenged and removed from libraries due to its contents. In 2013, a musical adaptation of Fun Home at The Public Theater enjoyed multiple extensions to its run, with book and lyrics written by Obie Award-winning playwright Lisa Kron, and score composed by Tony Award-nominated Jeanine Tesori. The production, directed by Sam Gold, was called \\"the first mainstream musical about a young lesbian.\\" As a musical theatre piece, Fun Home was a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, while winning the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Musical, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Musical, and the Obie Award for Musical Theater. The Broadway production opened in April 2015 and earned an even dozen nominations for the 69th Tony Awards, winning the Tony Award for Best Musical. == Background == Bechdel states that her motivation for writing Fun Home was to reflect on why things turned out the way they did in her life. She reflects on her father's untimely death and whether Alison would have made different choices if she were in his position. This motivation is present throughout as she contrasts Bruce's artifice in hiding things with Alison's free and open self. The process of writing Fun Home required many references to literary works and archives to both accurately write and draw the scenes. As Bechdel wrote the book, she would reread the sources of her literary references, and this attention to detail in her references lead to the development of each chapter having a different literary focus. On the process of writing the book, Bechdel says, \\"It was such a huge project: six or seven years of drawing and excavating. It was sort of like living in a trance.\\" Fun Home is drawn in black line art with a gray-blue ink wash. Sean Wilsey wrote that Fun Homes panels \\"combine the detail and technical proficiency of R. Crumb with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own.\\" Writing in the Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted \\"Bechdel's habit of drawing her characters very simply and yet distinctly\\" with \\"the attention to detail that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, not to mention the intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop.\\" Bechdel told an interviewer for The Comics Journal that the richness of each panel of Fun Home was very deliberate: Alison Bechdel took photographs of herself posing as each character, to use as reference in her drawing. Here, she poses for a drawing of her father. Bechdel wrote and illustrated Fun Home over a seven-year period. Her meticulous artistic process made the task of illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in Adobe Illustrator, on which she placed the text and drew rough figures. She used extensive photo reference and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a digital camera to record her poses. Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a Greenwich Village rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used Google Images to find a photograph of the New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period. She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative. After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish Bristol board for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer. The gray-blue ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of watercolor paper, and combined with the inked image using Photoshop. Bechdel chose the bluish wash color for its flexibility, and because it had \\"a bleak, elegiac quality\\" which suited the subject matter.Emmert, pp. 47‚Äì48. Print edition only. Bechdel attributes this detailed creative process to her \\"barely controlled obsessive- compulsive disorder\\".Emmert, p. 45. Print edition only. ==Plot summary== A panel from Fun Home depicting Bruce (left) and Alison Bechdel (right). The narrative of Fun Home is non- linear and recursive. Incidents are told and re-told in the light of new information or themes. Bechdel describes the structure of Fun Home as a labyrinth, \\"going over the same material, but starting from the outside and spiraling in to the center of the story.\\" In an essay on memoirs and truth in the academic journal PMLA, Nancy K. Miller explains that as Bechdel revisits scenes and themes \\"she re-creates memories in which the force of attachment generates the structure of the memoir itself.\\" Additionally, the memoir derives its structure from allusions to various works of literature, Greek myth and visual arts; the events of Bechdel's family life during her childhood and adolescence are presented through this allusive lens. Miller notes that the narratives of the referenced literary texts \\"provide clues, both true and false, to the mysteries of family relations.\\" The memoir focuses on Bechdel's family, and is centered on her relationship with her father, Bruce. Bruce was a funeral director and high school English teacher in Beech Creek, where Alison and her siblings grew up. The book's title comes from the family nickname for the funeral home, the family business in which Bruce grew up and later worked; the phrase also refers ironically to Bruce's tyrannical domestic rule. Bruce's two occupations are reflected in Fun Homes focus on death and literature. In the beginning of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 11, 18, 21, 68‚Äì69, 71. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 58‚Äì59, 61, 71, 79, 94‚Äì95, 120. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 27‚Äì30, 59, 85. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison concludes that her father committed suicide.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 23, 27‚Äì29, 89, 116‚Äì117, 125, 232. The story also deals with Alison's own struggle with her sexual identity, reaching a catharsis in the realization that she is a lesbian and her coming out to her parents.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 58, 74‚Äì81, The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood diary, anecdotes about masturbation, and tales of her first sexual experiences with her girlfriend, Joan.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 76, 80‚Äì81, 140‚Äì143, 148‚Äì149, 153, 157‚Äì159, 162, 168‚Äì174, 180‚Äì181, 183‚Äì186, 207, 214‚Äì215, 224. In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce share obsessive-compulsive tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: \\"I was Spartan to my father's Athenian. Modern to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his aesthete.\\"Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 15. This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given gender roles: \\"Not only were we inverts, we were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me. It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation.\\"Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 98. However, shortly before Bruce's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 220‚Äì221. At several points in the book, Bechdel questions whether her decision to come out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her father's suicide.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 57‚Äì59, 86, 117, 230‚Äì232. This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights. == Themes == Bechdel describes her journey of discovering her own sexuality: \\"My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about in a manner consistent with my bookish upbringing.\\"Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 74. Yet, hints of her sexual orientation arose early in her childhood; she wished \\"for the right to exchange [her] tank suit for a pair of shorts\\" in CannesBechdel, Fun Home, p. 73. and for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip.Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 113 Her father also exhibited homosexual behaviors, but the revelation of this made Bechdel feel uneasy. \\"I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy\\".Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 58. Father and daughter handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact, before she had a lesbian relationship, but her father hid his sexuality.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 76‚Äì81. He was afraid of coming out, as illustrated by \\"the fear in his eyes\\" when the conversation topic comes dangerously close to homosexuality.Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 219. In addition to sexual orientation, the memoir touches on the theme of gender identity. Bechdel had viewed her father as \\"a big sissy\\"Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 97 while her father constantly tried to change his daughter into a more feminine person throughout her childhood. The underlying theme of death is also portrayed. Unlike most young people, the Bechdel children have a tangible relationship with death because of the family mortuary business. Alison ponders whether her father's death was an accident or suicide, and finds it more likely that he killed himself purposefully.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 27-29. ==Allusions== The allusive literary references used in Fun Home are not merely structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, \\"I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms. And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison.\\"Bechdel, Fun Home, p. 67 Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of Daedalus and Icarus.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 3‚Äì4, 231‚Äì232. As a child, she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 34‚Äì35. Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 27‚Äì28, 47‚Äì49. His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald's, as portrayed in the biography The Far Side of Paradise.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 61‚Äì66, 84‚Äì86. His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 66‚Äì67, 70‚Äì71. Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress, and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew, and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was \\"a harbinger of my parents' later marriage\\".Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 69‚Äì70. Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with Oscar Wilde.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 154‚Äì155, 157‚Äì158, 163‚Äì168, 175, 180, 186. His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 92‚Äì97, 102, 105, 108‚Äì109, 113, 119‚Äì120. The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to E. H. Shepard's illustrations for The Wind in the Willows.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 130‚Äì131, 146‚Äì147, 150. Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs: the father gives the daughter Earthly Paradise, an autobiographical collection of the writings of Colette; shortly afterwards, in what Alison Bechdel describes as \\"an eloquent unconscious gesture\\", she leaves a library copy of Kate Millett's memoir Flying for him.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 205, 207‚Äì208, 217‚Äì220, 224, 229. Finally, returning to the Daedalus myth, Alison Bechdel casts herself as Stephen Dedalus and her father as Leopold Bloom in James Joyce's Ulysses, with parallel references to the myth of Telemachus and Odysseus.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 201‚Äì216, 221‚Äì223, 226, 228‚Äì231. The chapter headings, too, are all literary allusions. The first chapter, \\"Old Father, Old Artificer,\\" refers to line in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and the second, \\"A Happy Death,\\" invokes the Camus novel. \\"That Old Catastrophe\\" is a line from Wallace Stevens's \\"Sunday Morning,\\" and \\"In the Shadow of the Young Girls in Flower\\" is the literal translation of the title of one of the volumes of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, which is usually given in English as Within a Budding Grove. In addition to the literary allusions which are explicitly acknowledged in the text, Bechdel incorporates visual allusions to television programs and other items of pop culture into her artwork, often as images on a television in the background of a panel. These visual references include the film It's a Wonderful Life, Bert and Ernie of Sesame Street, the Smiley Face, Yogi Bear, Batman, the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, the resignation of Richard Nixon and The Flying Nun.Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 10‚Äì11 (It's a Wonderful Life), 14 (Sesame Street), 15 (Smiley Face), 92 (Yogi Bear), 130 (Batman), 174‚Äì175 (Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote), 181 (Nixon), 131, 193 (The Flying Nun). == Analysis == Heike Bauer, a professor at the University of London, categorizes Fun Home as part of the queer transnational archive for its contribution towards the \\"felt experiences\\" of the LGBTQ community. Bauer argues that books provide a relatable source, or a felt experience, as Alison uses literature to understand her own feelings in a homophobic society. Bauer notes that as Alison finds relatable literature for her experiences, Fun Home itself becomes a similar outlet for its readers by increasing representation of LGBTQ literature. Valerie Rohy, an English professor at the University of Vermont, questions the authenticity of Alison's archives in the book. Rohy explores how Alison uses her diary in her childhood and readings in her young adulthood to both document her life and learn about herself through written works. On the uncertainty relating to Bruce's cause of death, Rohy says Alison concludes it to be a suicide to fill in her knowledge gap of the situation, similar to her use of books to fill in gaps in her own understanding of her childhood. Judith Kegan Gardiner, a professor of English and Gender and Women's Studies at the University of Illinois, Chicago, views Fun Home as queer literature that bends the literary norms of the graphic novel genre.Judith Kegan Gardiner, Queering Genre: Alison Bechdel‚Äôs Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic and The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For, Contemporary Women's Writing, Volume 5, Issue 3, November 2011, Pages 188‚Äì207, https://doi.org/10.1093/cww/vpr015 Bechdel combines both tragedy, normally associated with men, and humor, normally associated with women, by discussing her father's death using a comic book style and dark humor. Gardiner argues Bechdel takes control of creating an open culture for lesbian feminist work through Fun Home by focusing less on Bruce's wrongdoings regarding minors, and more on the tragedy faced by Alison and the guilt towards his subsequent death after her coming out. Breaking the gender norms of the genre, particularly within lesbian and gay literature, Fun Home has dramatically affected representation. == Publication and reception == Fun Home was first printed in hardcover by Houghton Mifflin (Boston, New York) on June 8, 2006. This edition appeared on the New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction bestseller list for two weeks, covering the period from June 18 to July 1, 2006. It continued to sell well, and by February 2007 there were 55,000 copies in print. A trade paperback edition was published in the United Kingdom by Random House under the Jonathan Cape imprint on September 14, 2006; Houghton Mifflin published a paperback edition under the Mariner Books imprint on June 5, 2007. The French edition of Fun Home, published by √âditions Deno√´l In the summer of 2006, a French translation of Fun Home was serialized in the Paris newspaper Lib√©ration (which had previously serialized Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi). This translation, by Corinne Julve and Lili Sztajn, was subsequently published by √âditions Deno√´l on October 26, 2006. In January 2007, Fun Home was an official selection of the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. In the same month, the Anglophone Studies department of the Universit√© Fran√ßois Rabelais, Tours sponsored an academic conference on Bechdel's work, with presentations in Paris and Tours. At this conference, papers were presented examining Fun Home from several perspectives: as containing \\"trajectories\\" filled with paradoxical tension; as a text interacting with images as a paratext; and as a search for meaning using drag as a metaphor. These papers and others on Bechdel and her work were later published in the peer-reviewed journal GRAAT (Groupe de Recherches Anglo-Am√©ricaines de Tours, or Tours Anglo-American Research Group). An Italian translation was published by Rizzoli in January 2007. In Brazil, Conrad Editora published a Portuguese translation in 2007. A German translation was published by Kiepenheuer & Witsch in January 2008. The book has also been translated into Hungarian, Korean, and Polish, and a Chinese translation has been scheduled for publication. In Spring 2012, Bechdel and literary scholar Hillary Chute co- taught a course at the University of Chicago titled \\"Lines of Transmission: Comics and Autobiography\\". ===Reviews and awards=== Fun Home was positively reviewed in many publications. The Times of London described Fun Home as \\"a profound and important book;\\" Salon.com called it \\"a beautiful, assured piece of work;\\" and The New York Times ran two separate reviews and a feature on the memoir. In one New York Times review, Sean Wilsey called Fun Home \\"a pioneering work, pushing two genres (comics and memoir) in multiple new directions\\" and \\"a comic book for lovers of words\\". Jill Soloway, writing in the Los Angeles Times, praised the work overall but commented that Bechdel's reference-heavy prose is at times \\"a little opaque\\". Similarly, a reviewer in The Tyee felt that \\"the narrator's insistence on linking her story to those of various Greek myths, American novels and classic plays\\" was \\"forced\\" and \\"heavy-handed\\". By contrast, the Seattle Times' reviewer wrote positively of the book's use of literary reference, calling it \\"staggeringly literate\\". The Village Voice said that Fun Home \\"shows how powerfully‚Äîand economically‚Äîthe medium can portray autobiographical narrative. With two-part visual and verbal narration that isn't simply synchronous, comics presents a distinctive narrative idiom in which a wealth of information may be expressed in a highly condensed fashion.\\" Alison Bechdel at a London signing for Fun Home Several publications listed Fun Home as one of the best books of 2006, including The New York Times, Amazon.com, The Times of London, New York magazine and Publishers Weekly, which ranked it as the best comic book of 2006. Salon.com named Fun Home the best nonfiction debut of 2006, admitting that they were fudging the definition of \\"debut\\" and saying, \\"Fun Home shimmers with regret, compassion, annoyance, frustration, pity and love‚Äîusually all at the same time and never without a pervasive, deeply literary irony about the near-impossible task of staying true to yourself, and to the people who made you who you are.\\" Entertainment Weekly called it the best nonfiction book of the year, and Time named Fun Home the best book of 2006, describing it as \\"the unlikeliest literary success of 2006\\" and \\"a masterpiece about two people who live in the same house but different worlds, and their mysterious debts to each other.\\" Fun Home was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award, in the memoir/autobiography category. In 2007, Fun Home won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book, the Stonewall Book Award for non-fiction, the Publishing Triangle-Judy Grahn Nonfiction Award, and the Lambda Literary Award in the \\"Lesbian Memoir and Biography\\" category. Fun Home was nominated for the 2007 Eisner Awards in two categories, Best Reality-Based Work and Best Graphic Album, and Bechdel was nominated as Best Writer/Artist. Fun Home won the Eisner for Best Reality-Based Work. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly placed Fun Home at #68 in its list of \\"New Classics\\" (defined as \\"the 100 best books from 1983 to 2008\\"). The Guardian included Fun Home in its series \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\", noting its \\"beautifully rendered\\" details. In 2009, Fun Home was listed as one of the best books of the previous decade by The Times of London, Entertainment Weekly and Salon.com, and as one of the best comic books of the decade by The Onion's A.V. Club. Listed as #42 of 100. Listed as #7 of 10. Listed chronologically in a list of 10 non-fiction works. Listed alphabetically in a list of 25. In 2010, the Los Angeles Times literary blog \\"Jacket Copy\\" named Fun Home as one of \\"20 classic works of gay literature\\". In 2019, the graphic novel was ranked 33rd on The Guardians list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. ===Challenges and attempted banning=== In October 2006, a resident of Marshall, Missouri attempted to have Fun Home and Craig Thompson's Blankets, both graphic novels, removed from the city's public library. Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as \\"pornography\\" and expressed concern that they would be read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in \\"reputable, professional book review journals,\\" and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards \\"the slippery slope of censorship\\". On October 11, 2006, the library's board appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Fun Home and Blankets from circulation until the new policy was approved. The committee \\"decided not to assign a prejudicial label or segregate [the books] by a prejudicial system\\", and presented a materials selection policy to the board. On March 14, 2007, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees voted to return both Fun Home and Blankets to the library's shelves. Bechdel described the attempted banning as \\"a great honor\\", and described the incident as \\"part of the whole evolution of the graphic-novel form.\\"Emmert, p. 39. Retrieved on August 6, 2007. In 2008, an instructor at the University of Utah placed Fun Home on the syllabus of a mid-level English course, \\"Critical Introduction to English Literary Forms\\". One student objected to the assignment, and was given an alternate reading in accordance with the university's religious accommodation policy. The student subsequently contacted a local organization called \\"No More Pornography\\", which started an online petition calling for the book to be removed from the syllabus. Vincent Pecora, the chair of the university's English department, defended Fun Home and the instructor. The university said that it had no plans to remove the book. In 2013, Palmetto Family, a conservative South Carolina group affiliated with Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, challenged the inclusion of Fun Home as a reading selection for incoming freshmen at the College of Charleston. Palmetto Family president Oran Smith called the book \\"pornographic\\". Bechdel disputed this, saying that pornography is designed to cause sexual arousal, which is not the purpose of her book. College provost George Hynd and associate provost Lynne Ford defended the choice of Fun Home, pointing out that its themes of identity are especially appropriate for college freshmen. However, seven months later, the Republican-led South Carolina House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee cut the college's funding by $52,000, the cost of the summer reading program, to punish the college for selecting Fun Home. Rep. Garry Smith, who proposed the cuts, said that in choosing Fun Home the university was \\"promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle\\". Rep. Stephen Goldfinch, another supporter of the cuts, said, \\"This book trampled on freedom of conservatives. ... Teaching with this book, and the pictures, goes too far.\\" Bechdel called the funding cut \\"sad and absurd\\" and pointed out that Fun Home \\"is after all about the toll that this sort of small-mindedness takes on people's lives.\\" The full state House of Representatives subsequently voted to retain the cuts. College of Charleston students and faculty reacted with dismay and protests to the proposed cuts, and the college's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution urging that the funding be restored. A coalition of ten free-speech organizations wrote a letter to the South Carolina Senate Finance Committee, urging them to restore the funds and warning them that \\"[p]enalising state educational institutions financially simply because members of the legislature disapprove of specific elements of the educational program is educationally unsound and constitutionally suspect\\". The letter was co-signed by the National Coalition Against Censorship, the ACLU of South Carolina, the American Association of University Professors, the Modern Language Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, the Association of American Publishers, the National Council of Teachers of English and the American Library Association. After a nearly week-long debate in which Fun Home and Bechdel were compared to slavery, Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler, the state Senate voted to restore the funding, but redirect the funds towards study of the United States Constitution and The Federalist Papers; the university was also required to provide alternate books to students who object to an assignment due to a \\"religious, moral or cultural belief\\". Governor Nikki Haley approved the budget measure penalizing the university. In 2015, the book was assigned as summer reading for the incoming class of 2019 at Duke University. Several students objected to the book on moral and/or religious grounds. In 2018, parents challenged Fun Home in the Watching Hills Regional High School curriculum. The challenge was rejected, and the book remained in the school. One year later, a lawsuit was filed in May 2019 against the administrators of the school asking for removal of the book. The lawsuit claims that if the book is not removed, \\"minors will suffer irreparable harm and that New Jersey statutes will be violated.\\" After the Watching Hills High School challenge, administrators at nearby North Hunterdon High School removed Fun Home from their libraries as well, but the book was later restored in February 2019. ==Musical adaptation== Fun Home has been adapted into a stage musical, with a book by Lisa Kron and music by Jeanine Tesori. The musical was developed through a 2009 workshop at the Ojai Playwrights Conference and workshopped in 2012 at the Sundance Theatre Lab and The Public Theater's Public Lab. Bechdel did not participate in the musical's creation. She expected her story to seem artificial and distant on stage, but she came to feel that the musical had the opposite effect, bringing the \\"emotional heart\\" of the story closer than even her book did. The musical debuted Off-Broadway at The Public Theater on September 30, 2013. The production was directed by Sam Gold and starred Michael Cerveris and Judy Kuhn as Bruce and Helen Bechdel. The role of Alison was played by three actors: Beth Malone played the adult Alison, reviewing and narrating her life, Alexandra Socha played \\"Medium Alison\\" as a student at Oberlin, discovering her sexuality, and Sydney Lucas played Small Alison, at age 10. It received largely positive reviews, and its limited run was extended several times until January 12, 2014. The musical was a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Drama; it also won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Musical, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Musical, and the Obie Award for Musical Theater. Alison Bechdel drew a one-page comic about the musical adaptation for the newspaper Seven Days. A Broadway production opened at Circle in the Square Theatre in April 2015. The production won five 2015 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and ran for 26 previews and 582 regular performances until September 10, 2016, with a national tour that began in October 2016.Gordon, Jessica Fallon. \\"Photo Coverage: Fun Home Closes on Broadway with Emotional Final Curtain Call\\", BroadwayWorld.com, September 11, 2016 Kalle Oskari Mattila, in The Atlantic, argued that the musical's marketing campaign \\"obfuscates rather than clarifies\\" the queer narrative of the original novel.Mattila, Kalle Oskari. \\"Selling Queerness: The Curious Case of Fun Home\\", The Atlantic, April 25, 2016. Retrieved November 23, 2017 ==Film adaptation== On January 3, 2020, it was announced that Jake Gyllenhaal and his Nine Stories Productions banner secured the rights to adapt the musical version of Fun Home into a film.

The zoo was opened to the public with mostly indigenous animals including bears, deer, bobcat, foxes, ducks and prairie dogs. A monkey dome was constructed in 1962, and 26 colobus monkeys were added to the zoos residents. In the latter part of the 1960s, the zoo was fenced, walkways were paved, and chimpanzee building was added to the exhibits. The zoo also added a sea lions, otters, a macaw and two leopards.

In 1991 a mid to late neolithic fortified settlement was excavated on the Kapf/Chapf hill. This settlement was surrounded by a huge moat, and presumably protected by palisades. Inside the settlement wooden beams, fire pits, a clay pit and numerous stone tools were found. In addition, many individual Stone and Bronze Age objects have been found throughout the municipality. An Iron Age midden heap was found at Rifeld. Below the Gasthaus (combination hotel and restaurant) Anker are the foundations of a Roman small fort from the second half of the 4th Century and a nearby soldier's grave from the same period. Between Mumpf and Stein, a fragment of a milestone, with an inscription, from the time of Antoninus Pius (139 AD) was discovered. Mumpf is first mentioned in 1218 as Mumpher. In 1278 it was mentioned as Nider-Mumpfe. It was known as Nieder-Mumpf until 1803. It was first mentioned as being part of the lands ruled by the Counts of Homburg. It later came to be under the Habsburg urbarium (a collection of regulations, which related nobleman and peasants and their mutual obligations) and their high court as part of the S√§ckingen district. Under the Habsburgs, Wallbach and Mumpf formed at vogtei in the landschaft M√∂hlinbach under the Herrschaft of Rheinfelden. The low court rights were originally held by manor house Stein which was owned by S√§ckingen Abbey. In 1463 these rights went to the Austrian-appointed vogt. The village laws were first handed down in 1535. Then, in 1612 a general assembly of the Rhine region adopted a notice of appeal on the ever-increasing taxes and increasing impoverishment. This document led to the Rappenkrieg, a peasant uprising that lasted from 1612 until 1614. During the Thirty Years War Mumpf was looted several times. Following the Act of Mediation in 1803, the entire Fricktal, including Mumpf, joined the new Canton of Aargau. St. Martin's church in Mumpf is first mentioned in 1441. It was renovated and expanded in 1541 and in 1741 the choir was rebuilt. The most recent renovation and reconstruction took place in 1957. The rights to collect church taxes were held by S√§ckingen Abbey until 1802 or 1803. The Mumpf parish included Wallbach until 1938. Until the 19th Century fishing, timber rafting and grain production were the main sources of income in the village. Therefore, Mumpf and Wallbach were major members of the Rhine association. Although the Rhine ferry (which has operated since the Middle Ages) is still in operation, most traffic now uses either the old bridge, the railway bridge which opened in 1875 or the A3 motorway bridge from the 1970s. A large proportion of the population works in the Fricktaler chemical company and in the agglomeration of Basel. ==Geography== Mumpf has an area, , of .

It is known for its gold mineralisation and for its komatiites, an unusual type of ultramafic volcanic rock named after the Komati River that flows through the belt. Some of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth (greater than 3.6 Ga) are located in the Barberton Greenstone Belt of the Swaziland‚ÄìBarberton areas and these contain some of the oldest traces of life on Earth. Only the rocks found in the Isua Greenstone Belt of Western Greenland are older. == History and description == In April 2014, scientists reported finding evidence of the largest terrestrial meteor impact event to date near the Barberton Greenstone Belt. They estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago (during the Paleoarchean era of the Archean eon of the Precambrian supereon) and that the impactor was approximately 37 to 58 kilometers (23 to 36 miles) wide, roughly five times larger than the impactor responsible for the Chicxulub crater in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, which was around the size of Mount Everest. The gigantic impactor was estimated to have collided with the Earth at a speed of 20 kilometers per second (12 miles per second), releasing an enormous amount of energy and triggering magnitude 10.8 earthquakes across the planet, as well as generating megatsunamis thousands of meters high. The crater from this event, if it still exists, has not yet been found. The Barberton Greenstone Belt consists of a sequence of mafic to ultramafic lavas and metasedimentary rocks emplaced and deposited between 3.5 and 3.2 Ga. The granitoid rocks were emplaced over a 500-million-year time span and can be divided into two suites: The tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suite (emplaced approximately 3.5‚Äì3.2 Ga), and the granite‚Äìmonzogranite‚Äìsyenite granite (GMS) suite (emplaced approximately 3.2‚Äì3.1 Ga). The GMS suite are found over large parts of the Kaapvaal Craton and their emplacement coincides with the first stabilisation of the central parts of the craton. \\"The GMS suite in the Barberton granite-greenstone terrane shows very different internal and external characteristics from the earlier TTG suite. Individual plutons may cover several thousand square kilometres and these composite granitoid bodies have traditionally been referred to as batholiths, alluding to their compositionally and texturally heterogeneous nature and enormous areal extent. For the most part, the plutons appear undeformed.\\" The Barberton area underwent two tectonic episodes of terrane accretion at about 3.5 and 3.2 Ga. Early stages of shield development are exposed in the Barberton Mountains where the continent formation first took place by magmatic accretion and tectonic amalgamation of small protocontinental blocks. Several small diachronous blocks (3.6‚Äì3.2 Ga) have been found in the area. Apparently each block represents a cycle of arc-related magmatism and sedimentation. The Hooggenoeg Formation of the Barberton Greenstone Belt is dated at 3.45 Ga. and evolved through magmatism. This crustal development phase was followed by a period of Mesoarchaean cratonic magmatism (3.1‚Äì3.0 Ga) and is marked by the formation of a large crescent-shaped, juvenile arc that was accreted onto the northern and western margins of the evolving Kaapvaal shield. Archaean greenstone belts are hypothesized to have been formed from passive margin oceanic crust that became part of an extensive subduction-undercut margin. The TTG intrusions are thought to have been formed by post-subduction magmatism when subduction was halted, perhaps by arrival of a micro-craton. The 3.1 Ga Mpuluzi batholith in the Barberton granite‚Äìgneiss terrane is made up of granite sheets. The structurally higher parts are underlain by an anastomosing network of steeply dipping, variably deformed dikes and sheets. According to a study done by Westraat et al. (2005): \\"Multiple intrusive relationships and geochronological evidence suggests that granite sheeting and the assembly of the pluton occurred over a period of 3‚Äì13 million years. The spatial and temporal relationship between deformation and magma emplacement reflects episodes of incremental dilation related to deformation along the bounding shear zones and granite sheeting. The transition to the mainly subhorizontal granite sheets at higher structural levels of the tabular Mpuluzi batholith indicates the intrusion of the granites during subhorizontal regional shortening, where the reorientation of the minimum normal stress to vertical attitudes at the shallow levels of emplacement allowed for vertical dilation and subhorizontal emplacement of the granite sheets.\\" ==Barberton Greenstone Belt TTG and GMS suites== The Barberton Mountain is a well preserved pre-3.0 Ga granite-greenstone terrane. The greenstone belt consists of a sequence of mafic to ultramafic lavas and metasedimentary rocks emplaced and deposited between 3.5 and 3.2 Ga. The granitoid rocks were emplaced over a 500 million year time span and can be divided into two suites. The TTG suite (emplaced approximately 3.5‚Äì3.2 Ga) contains tonalites, trondhjemites and granodiorites; and the GMS suite (emplaced approximately 3.2‚Äì3.1 Ga) includes granites, monzogranites and a small syenite‚Äìgranite complex. According to a study by Yearron et al. (2003): \\"The TTGs are typically low- to medium-K, metaluminous I-type granites, Their chondrite-normalised REE patterns show two trends. The majority of plutons are LREE-enriched, HREE-depleted and with small or no Eu anomalies, whilst the Steynsdorp and Doornhoek plutons are relatively HREE- undepleted with significant Eu anomalies. Nd isotope analyses show that the 3.4 Ga TTGs have positive ŒµNd values (0 to +3.7), indicative of depleted- mantle sources, similar to the oldest greenstone belt formations (the Onverwacht). In contrast, the 3.2 Ga TTGs have negative ŒµNd, suggesting crustal or enriched-mantle input into the magmas. Extensive granite plutons of a subsequent magmatic episode are associated with the intrusion of vast amounts of granodiorite-monzogranite-syenite GMS suites. The GMS rocks are medium- and high-K metaluminous I-typerocks. They display two dominant REE patterns. Medium-K GMS rocks (the Dalmeinand portions of Heerenveen) are LREE- enriched, HREE-depleted and have no Eu-anomalies, whereas, the high-K GMSs (Heerenveen, Mpuluzi and Boesmanskop) are relatively HREE-enriched with negative Eu anomalies. Positive and negative ŒµNd values (‚àí4.4 to +4.8) for the Boesmanskop Syenite suggests depleted-mantle and crystal signatures. The ŒµNd and REE patterns, in particular, provide insights into the compositions of potential source rocks and restites for the TTG and GMS suites. Since HREEs and Eu are readily accommodated in garnet and plagioclase, respectively, their depletion suggests the presence of these minerals in the restite. For the TTG suite, we therefore suggest a garnet-rich amphibolitic or eclogitic depleted- mantle source at a depth >40 km. This has been confirmed by experimental work constraining the stability of garnet in the trondhjemite compositions, and at magmatic temperatures, to a pressure of 15.24 ¬± 0.5 kbar corresponding to a depth of 54.9 ¬± 1.8 km. In contrast, the GMS suite most probably had a plagioclase-rich, garnet-poor source that may be a mixture of depleted-mantle and crustal materials. The two episodes of terrane accretion at ‚àº3.5 and 3.2 Ga correspond to ages of TTG magmatism. This compressional tectonic regime, and the partial melting of greenstone-type material, suggest that basaltic amphibolites of the greenstone sequences are the source materials for the TTG suites. The likely source rocks for the GMS suite are not easily deduced, but chemistry and ŒµNd values of the Boesmanskop syenite suggest a hybrid mantle- crustal source. This type of hybrid source might also explain the features of the monzogranitic batholiths. Close associations between syenite and monzogranites are common, particularly in post-orogenic extensional/transtensional settings. Although extensional activity has not been documented in Barberton, ‚àº3.1 Ga strike-slip activity has. A post- orogenic thinning of the crust might explain the production of large voluminous monzogranite batholiths and the passive nature of their intrusion dynamics.\\" ==Hooggenoeg Formation of the Barberton Greenstone Belt== Some controversy exists pertaining to the origin and emplacement of Archaean felsic suites. According to a dissertation by Louzada (2003): \\"The upper part of the Hooggenoeg FormationSandsta, N.R., B. Robins, H. Furnes, and M. de Wit (2011) The origin of large varioles in flow-banded pillow lava from the Hooggenoeg Complex, Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology. vol. 162, no. 2, pp. 365‚Äì377. is characterized by ultramafic massive and pillow lavas, a trondhjemitic suite of silicified felsic intrusive and flow banded rocks, and sedimentary chert beds. Veins of felsic, chert and ultramafic material intrude the belt. The depositional environment is thought to be a shoaling shallow sea in which the Hooggenoeg Formation has been deposited in a west-block down, listric faulted, synsedimentary setting.\\" The Hooggenoeg Formation felsic rocks can be divided into two groups: an intrusive group of interlocking and shallow intrusive rocks, and a porphyritic group of rocks from the veins. Lavas from the upper part of the felsic unit are too altered to be assigned to one of these groups. The intrusive group is related to the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite TTG-suite Stolzburg Pluton, which intruded along the southern margin of the Barberton Greenstone Belt. Melting of an amphibolite quartz eclogite has been suggested as a probable origin for these high-Al2O3 felsic magmas. Ultramafic rocks of the Hooggenoeg Formation were most likely not parental for the felsic rocks. Subduction processes may have played a role in the generation of the felsic rocks, but a tectonic setting for the ultramafic rocks remains uncertain. The felsic units of the Hooggenoeg Formation are very similar to those of the Panorama Formation of the Early Archaean Coppin Gap greenstone belt of Western Australia (See Yilgarn Craton). Similarities in geological setting, petrography, and geochemical (trace element in particular) characteristics suggest a possible genetic relation between the two formations and support the theory that a combined continent Vaalbara existed ~3.45 Ga. ==See also== * Chicxulub crater * List of impact craters on Earth * List of possible impact structures on Earth ==NotesReferences== * Louzda, K.

It is named for the Ancient Roman city of Augusta Raurica whose ruins are situated nearby. The prefix Kaiser- (\\"imperial\\") refers to the fact that from medieval times this town formed part of the Habsburg territory of Further Austria, as opposed to neighbouring village of Augst, part of the then Canton of Basel in the Old Swiss Confederacy. ==History== Reconstruction of a bath at Augusta Raurica About AD 300, following the loss of the Limes Germanicus and the right bank of the Rhine, the Roman army built a fort near the city of Augusta Raurica. The fort, which was named Castrum Rauracense was intended to serve as the headquarters of the legio I Martia and to protect a ford over the Rhine. During the 4th century, the fort grew in importance because it commanded a bridge that lay along the road from Gaul to the Danube. Emperors Constantius II and Julian assembled their armies at the Castrum Rauracense before marching to battle against the Alemanni. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire the fort remained occupied as local Germanic tribes moved in. The fort and neighboring church became the seat of a bishop during the 4th century, with the bishop first being mentioned in 346. In the 7th century the bishop moved to Basel and the settlement declined in importance. In 752 a village called Augusta was first mentioned, however it was not until 1442 that the village of Augst split into Augst and Kaiseraugst. In 894 the East Francian King Arnulf granted the church in Kaiseraugst to his vassal Anno. The church was then granted to the Abbey of St Gall and then later to the Basel M√ºnster. The original church, built in AD 400, was replaced with a new building in 1749. Following the Act of Mediation in 1803 the church was granted to the new canton of Aargau. In 1878 the majority of the community became Christian Catholic and took over the church. In 1900/01 the Roman Catholic church was built and the original church's property was divided. In the early 1960s, the Kaiseraugst nuclear power plant construction project was met with strong opposition from the population, who occupied the site in 1975. After the Chernobyl disaster, the Swiss government and Kaiseraugst Nuclear Energy AG agreed to abandon the project. ==Geography== Aerial view (1963) Kaiseraugst has an area, , of .

He enlisted in the Naval Reserve at Chicago, Illinois in September 1942 and received training at Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, Illinois, and at Lawrence, Kansas, before being assigned as a Fireman Third Class on board the destroyer in June 1943. While serving in that ship, he advanced in rate to watertender second class. On February 14, 1945, Bigelow's actions averted tragedy on board the USS Fletcher. While assisting minesweeping operations prior to landings on Manila Bay's Corregidor Island, Fletcher was hit by an enemy shell which penetrated the No. 1 gun magazine, igniting several powder cases. Bigelow picked up a pair of fire extinguishers and rushed below in a resolute attempt to quell the raging flames. Refusing to waste the precious time required to don rescue-breathing apparatus, Bigelow plunged through the blinding smoke billowing out of the magazine hatch and dropped into the blazing compartment. Despite the acrid, burning powder smoke which seared his lungs, he succeeded in quickly extinguishing the fires and in cooling the cases and bulkheads, thereby preventing further damage to the ship.

The modern municipality of Obermumpf is first mentioned around 1302-04 as Obermumphier. Until 1797 it was part of the Austrian Habsburgs district of Rheinfelden. After the Act of Mediation in 1803, the entire Fricktal, including Obermumpf, went to the newly formed Canton of Aargau. The low justice right was held by the manor house Stein, which was owned by S√§ckingen Abbey. Later those rights transferred to the Austrians. The Church of St. Peter and Paul, whose patronage rights originally belonged to the collegiate church of S√§ckingen, has a tower from 1494 and a nave from 1738. The original church, from the 8th Century, was built on the foundations of a Roman estate. Since 1889 it has been the center of the Christian Catholic parish of Obermumpf-Wallbach. In 1893-94 a catholic church was constructed, and was rebuilt in 1962. ==Geography== Obermumpf has an area, , of .

Singles are routinely deleted after a period of weeks, but an album by a major artist may remain in the catalog indefinitely. When titles are deleted in the US, the remaining stock would be defaced with a cut-out through the sleeve or case. Cut-out records formed a grey market outside the major distribution channels. In the 1993 book Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia Bill Knoedelseder wrote of how MCA Records became the subject of a federal investigation of its cut-out sales practices after a deal allegedly involving organized crime. ==Effects== Deletion in the music industry differs from print publishing in that recording contracts generally do not return the rights to the artist when a title ceases to be manufactured. When PolyGram took over JMT Records, a small jazz label, in 1995, it was understood to have announced that the entire JMT catalogue would be deleted, shocking dozens of artists. According to Tim Berne, \\"this means that the majority of my work simply vanishes.\\" According to Louis Barfe, \\"many deleted gems are locked in archives, unheard and quite possibly deteriorating.\\" Although he recommends that they digitize this music and offer it for download, he notes that \\"niche labels have sprung up specialising in reissuing out-of-copyright recordings\\". Some bootlegs have been issued just so fans can obtain deleted recordings without having to search the second hand market for them. ==Digital media== More recently, the rise of digital media has eliminated much of the cost of music distribution, and companies have begun to see deleted records for their long tail potential, selling via iTunes and other online means. A single company, ArkivMusic, has struck deals with all four major publishers (and numerous minor ones) of classical music recordings to make their deleted records available via a burn-on-demand service. ==Exceptions== A prominent exception to the practice was the label Folkways Records, whose founder Moe Asch \\"never deleted a single title from the ... catalogue\\". According to Asch, \\"Just because the letter J is less popular than the letter S, you don't take it out of the dictionary.\\" When the label was disbanded, Asch enlisted the Smithsonian Institution to maintain the catalogue \\"in perpetuity\\". ==Examples== Scott 4 was released late in 1969, the same year as Scott 3. It was credited as being by Noel Scott Engel. It failed to chart and as a result, the album was deleted soon after release. In July 1972, the British music paper, Melody Maker, reported that a cutprice LP issued by Virgin Records was facing deletion because, ironically, it was too popular. Faust's The Faust Tapes, then at number 18 in Melody Makers chart, actually cost more to produce than its selling price (49p) and so Virgin lost supposedly ¬£2,000 on sales of 60,000. It has since been argued that this move was merely a publicity stunt by Virgin's owner, Richard Branson. In 1990, Arista Records deleted Milli Vanilli's album Girl You Know It's True very quickly after Frank Farian admitted that Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan did not sing on the record. The British duo The KLF summarily deleted their entire back catalogue when they 'retired' from the music industry in 1992. Manic Street Preachers' 2000 single \\"The Masses Against The Classes\\" was deleted on day of release as a promotional gimmick. This allowed it to reach Number 1 in the charts and remained in the charts for 7 weeks. However, copies of the single continued to be available until supplies ran out, making second hand copies plentiful. The 2006 Gnarls Barkley single \\"Crazy\\" was deleted by Warner Music after six weeks at #1 in the UK as a deliberate move to protect it from overexposure. Deleted singles could not then remain on the UK Singles Chart, so the physical single no longer charted after two weeks. However, it remained as a high- selling download single and has continued to receive heavy airplay well after the single was deleted. On 20 April 2013, Dutch composer John Ewbank deleted his song \\"Koningslied\\" (\\"The King's Song\\") only two days after its initial release, citing an overload of criticism aimed at him personally and at the song itself from the general public and the media. The song had been commissioned to act as the official song of Willem Alexander, Prince of Orange's upcoming investiture as the new King of the Netherlands on 30 April 2013. The song, already at number one in the iTunes download charts on the day of its release, was performed by a large number of well known Dutch artists. ==See also== * Out of print ==References== Category:Music industry ","title":"Deletion (music industry)"},{"id":"6251784","text":"Eugene Booker McDaniels (February 12, 1935 - July 29, 2011) was an American singer and songwriter. He had his greatest recording success in the early 1960s, and had continued success as a songwriter with songs including \\"Compared to What\\" and Roberta Flack's \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\". ==Background== Born in Kansas City, Kansas, United States, McDaniels grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. As well as singing gospel music in church, he developed a love of jazz, and learned to play the saxophone and trumpet. After forming a singing group, the Echoes of Joy, later known as the Sultans, in his teens, he studied at the University of Omaha Conservatory of Music before joining the Mississippi Piney Woods Singers, with whom he toured in California. ==Career 1960s‚Äì1970s === In California, McDaniels began singing in jazz clubs, achieving recognition with the Les McCann Trio, and came to the attention of Sy Waronker of Liberty Records.Biography by Bruce Eder at Allmusic.comRichard Williams, Obituary, The Guardian, 15 August 2011. After recording two unsuccessful singles and an album, McDaniels teamed with producer Snuff Garrett, with whom he recorded his first hit, \\"A Hundred Pounds of Clay\\", which reached number 3 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1961 and sold over one million copies, earning gold disc status. Its follow-up, \\"A Tear\\", was less successful but his third single with Garrett, \\"Tower of Strength\\", co-written by Burt Bacharach, reached number 5 and won McDaniels his second gold record. \\"Tower of Strength\\" reached number 49 in the UK Singles Chart, losing out to Frankie Vaughan's chart-topping version. In 1962, McDaniels appeared performing \\"Another Tear Falls\\" in the movie It's Trad, Dad! directed by Richard Lester. He continued to have hit records, including \\"Chip Chip\\", \\"Point Of No Return\\", and \\"Spanish Lace\\", each in 1962, but his suave style of singing gradually became less fashionable. In 1965 \\"Point Of No Return\\" was recorded by the British R&B; band Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames on their UK Columbia EP Fame At Last. Also in 1965, McDaniels moved to Columbia Records, with little success, and in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, he left the US to live in Denmark and Sweden, where he concentrated on songwriting. After the late 1960s, McDaniels turned his attention to a more black consciousness form, and his best-known song in this genre was \\"Compared to What\\", a jazz-soul protest song made famous (and into a hit) by Les McCann and Eddie Harris on their album Swiss Movement and also covered by Roberta Flack, Ray Charles, Della Reese, John Legend, the Roots, Sweetwater, and others. He returned to the US in 1971 and recorded thereafter as Eugene McDaniels. McDaniels also attained the top spot on the chart as a songwriter. In 1974, Roberta Flack reached number 1 with his \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" (not to be confused with the Bad Company song of the same name), which received a Grammy Award nomination. McDaniels also received a BMI award for outstanding radio airplay; at the time of the award, the song had already had over five million plays. In the early 1970s, McDaniels recorded on the Atlantic label, which released his albums Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse and Outlaw. === 1980s‚Äì2000s === In the 1980s, McDaniels recorded an album with the percussionist Terry Silverlight, which has not yet been released. In 2005, McDaniels released Screams & Whispers on his own record label. In 2009, it was announced that McDaniels was to release a new album, Evolution's Child, which featured his lyrics, and a number of songs composed or arranged with pianist Ted Brancato. Some of the songs featured jazz musician Ron Carter on concert bass and Terri Lyne Carrington on drums. McDaniel's \\"Jagger the Dagger\\" was featured on the Tribe Vibes breakbeat compilation album, after it had been sampled by A Tribe Called Quest. McDaniels also appeared in films. They included It's Trad, Dad! (1962, released in the United States as Ring-A-Ding Rhythm), which was directed by Richard Lester. McDaniels also appeared in The Young Swingers (1963). He is briefly seen singing in the choir in the 1974 film Uptown Saturday Night. He was the original voice actor for \\"Nasus\\", a champion in the computer game League of Legends. In 2010 he launched a series of YouTube videos on his website, featuring his music and thoughts on some of his creations. ==Personal life and death== McDaniels lived as a self-described \\"hermit\\" in the state of Maine. McDaniels died peacefully on July 29, 2011, at his home, survived by his third wife and six children. ==DiscographyAlbums=== {  style=text-align:center; - !Year !Album !Record Label - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1960 align=left In Times Like These rowspan=\\"8\\" Liberty Records - align=left Somestimes I'm Happy Sometimes I'm Blue - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1961 align=left 100 Lbs. of Clay! - align=left Tower of Strength - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1962 align=left Hit After Hit - align=left Gene McDaniels Sings Movie Memories - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1963 align=left The Wonderful World of Gene McDaniels - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1966 align=left The Facts of Life - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1970 align=left Outlaw rowspan=\\"2\\" Atlantic Records - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1971 align=left Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1975 align=left Natural Juices rowspan=\\"1\\" Ode Records - rowspan=\\"1\\" 2004 align=leftScreams and Whispers rowspan=\\"1\\" Genepool Records } As Universal Jones {  style=text-align:center; - !Year !Album !Record Label - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1972 align=left Universal Jones Vol. 1 rowspan=\\"1\\" MGM Records - } ===Singles=== {  style=text-align:center; - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !rowspan=\\"2\\"Titles (A-side, B-side) Both sides from same album except where indicated !colspan=\\"4\\"Peak chart positions !rowspan=\\"2\\"Record Label !rowspan=\\"2\\"Album - style=\\"font- size:smaller;\\" !align=centre US !align=centre AC !align=centre R&B; !align=centre UK - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1960 align=left \\"In Times Like These\\" b/w Once Before\\" (Non-album track)  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì rowspan=\\"17\\" Liberty Records align=\\"left\\" In Times Like These - align=left \\"Green Door\\" b/w \\"The Facts of Life\\"  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì align=\\"left\\" Sometimes I'm Happy Sometimes I'm Blue - rowspan=\\"5\\" 1961 align=left \\"A Hundred Pounds Of Clay\\" b/w \\"Come On Take A Chance\\" (Non-album track)  3  ‚Äì  11  ‚Äì align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 100 Lbs.

It was established in 1993 and named for its proximity to the geographical ridge of the Nisqually River valley. It earned its school nickname due to its location within the Hawk's Prairie area of Thurston County off Exit 111 of Interstate 5, serving students living in Mushroom Corner and Tanglewilde-Thompson Place. River Ridge and its feeder school, Nisqually Middle School, serves many students with parents who are on active duty or have retired from the military due to its proximity to Joint Base Lewis-McChord.Students, community groups send love, treats and prayers to troops Accessed 10 November 2009 River Ridge was constructed as a community solution to handle the over-flowing capacities of neighboring Timberline and North Thurston High Schools in the late 1980s-early 1990s, producing a more diverse student body population than the other two high schools in the district. ==HistoryCampus=== Front plaza River Ridge is a high school established in the Lacey area and was the first in the school district to carry on a unique house system of organizing classrooms, dubbed \\"school within a school\\": students were split into the four houses (Kalama(A), Olympic(B), Cascade(C), and Durazno(D)) in which each house has its own office and administrative team.. Other buildings served to house electives, athletics, library media center, and main administrative offices. The house system was discontinued in 2011, and house buildings currently group classrooms by academic discipline. There is also another complex near D house called Sommer hall; it currently has STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) classes. A common criticism in the school's architectural layout is the use of breezeway to connect the seven buildings, which provides little protection from the Pacific Northwest weather. Renovations began in 2018 to add an auxiliary gymnasium where the junior varsity baseball field had previously been located.https://www.nthurston.k12.wa.us/Page/21308 Until 2000 the campus shared space with the experimental high school, New Century High School, which relocated as South Sound High School in 2001. ===Academics=== Since its start until 2009, River Ridge has had Graduation Project as a required class for its seniors; this was before it became a mandatory statewide requirement in Washington.Complete a Culminating Project (Senior Project), Graduation Requirements, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Washington State Wood shop is not offered. In addition, three foreign language classes offered are Spanish, Japanese, and French (in order of enrollment). German was offered in the past. In addition, like most American high schools, many students choose to participate in Advanced Placement (AP) classes, allowing them to earn college credit in Calculus, Physics, Government, and World History among others. College-bound students have opportunities to earn college credit during their tenure at RRHS. Like many schools in Washington State, River Ridge lets its students to participate in the Running Start program, allowing them to attend college classes while simultaneously satisfying high school graduation requirements. River Ridge Running Start participants attend nearby South Puget Sound Community College in its Tumwater or Hawks Prairie campuses or at Pierce College in Lakewood. Career-minded students interested in a vocational education are able to attend classes at New Market Vocational Skills Center in Tumwater. ===Graduation Ceremony=== Every year River Ridge has a formal graduation ceremony held at the St Martin's Pavilion in Lacey WA. 2019 Graduation Ceremony Orchestra Performance - RRHS Orchestra Lead by Peter Chambers National Anthem - Elizabeth Donovan Valedictorian Speech - Colin Mayo & Mathew Jenkins \\"Not Only Just Ourselves\\" Speech - Jace Valente 2020 Graduation Ceremony- TBD Updated** == Activities  Arts === River Ridge has two choirs (Concert and Symphonic), two string orchestras, and three band classes (Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, and Jazz Ensemble).

The school's track team, under the lead of coach Phil Lonborg, has been known for winning league championships every year, Boy's District Championships in 2007 and 2009, and has won back to back Girls' State Track and Field Championships in 1994 and 1995. Girls' Basketball and Volleyball have also been very successful from 2003‚Äì2007. The baseball team has seen recent success as well by winning 2 league titles in 2004 & 2006, a district title in 2008, and have made three playoff appearances since 2004 including a 5th place state finish in 2006. In 2007, the Girls' Basketball team won the State 2A Championship while the Boys Basketball team went on to win 3rd place. 2008 marks the second consecutive year that both teams qualified for the state tournament. {  - ! colspan=4State Championships - !

He began his career at Liverpool, but did not play a game, and also had a loan to Leeds United and a transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers without playing for either Championship club. After playing five League Two games for Chester City and Hereford United in 2006, he had a season with Southport in the Conference. Harrison joined The New Saints in 2007 and remained there for over a decade, making over 400 Cymru Premier appearances and winning a number of honours. ==CareerLiverpool, Leeds and Wolves=== Born in Liverpool, Harrison attended Liverpool F.C.'s youth academy. He never made a first-team appearance, but when second-choice goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was injured, Harrison sat on the substitutes' bench as cover for Jerzy Dudek. His first game on the bench was on 15 May 2004 in the Premier League season finale 1‚Äì1 home draw with Newcastle United, which qualified the team for the UEFA Champions League. On 21 January 2005, Harrison moved to Championship club Leeds United on a one-month loan as part of the deal that saw fellow goalkeeper Scott Carson transfer permanently in the other direction. Released by Liverpool that summer, Harrison played for Wolverhampton Wanderers's reserves against Blackburn Rovers, and earned a two- month contract with the Championship club on 4 November 2005. ===Chester, Hereford and Southport=== When Harrison's Wolves contract expired, he joined Chester City of League Two until the end of the season on 24 February 2006; two days earlier while on trial, he saved a penalty in a reserve draw with Tranmere Rovers. He finally made his professional debut on 7 March in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with Torquay United during Chris Mackenzie's injury lay-off, with his performance being good enough for Chester to terminate the contract of fellow goalkeeper St√©phane Gillet. He made four consecutive appearances over the month, concluding on 26 March in the Cross-border derby with Wrexham when he saved a penalty from Matt Crowell in a 2‚Äì1 away loss. Mackenzie then returned to the Blues' goal, and Harrison played no further part. After Harrison left Chester, he joined newly promoted League Two team Hereford United. In their first game of the season, a 2‚Äì0 win at Stockport County on 5 August, he came on for the last 19 minutes due to Wayne Brown's groin injury. Six days later, he left Edgar Street on a free transfer to Conference National team Southport. ===The New Saints=== In the summer of 2007, Harrison joined Welsh Premier League champions The New Saints. He signed a new contract with TNS in May 2012. In June 2016, Harrison was inducted into the Welsh Premier League's Hall of Fame. At the time, his statistics read as 286 league appearances, 6 league titles, 4 Welsh Cups and 5 Welsh League Cups. In July 2017, Harrison became the Welsh Premier League player with the most European appearances when he surpassed former teammate Phil Baker's 31 in an extra-time win over Gibraltar's Europa. On 10 January 2020, Harrison made his 400th league appearance for TNS as they won 2‚Äì0 at Newtown. ==Personal life== When Harrison was four in 1989, his father Gary died aged 27 in the Hillsborough disaster, alongside his uncle Stephen. In May 2009 for the 20th anniversary of the tragedy, he captained a Liverpool Legends team in a charity match against celebrities at Anfield. ==Honours== New Saints * Welsh Premier League: 2009‚Äì10, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2016‚Äì17, 2017‚Äì18, 2018‚Äì19 * Welsh Cup: 2011‚Äì12, 2013‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2018‚Äì19 * Welsh League Cup: 2008‚Äì09, 2009‚Äì10, 2010‚Äì11, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2016‚Äì17, 2017‚Äì18 Individual * Welsh Premier League Team of the Year: 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14 ==ReferencesCategory:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Liverpool Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:English footballers Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Southport F.C. players Category:The New Saints F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Cymru Premier players ","title":"Paul Harrison (footballer, born 1984)"},{"id":"6251837","text":"The Environmental Law Foundation (ELF) is a UK registered charity, dedicated to environmental law and disseminating information on the subject.

The most common gear-cutting processes include hobbing, broaching, milling, and grinding. Such cutting operations may occur either after or instead of forming processes such as forging, extruding, investment casting, or sand casting. Gears are commonly made from metal, plastic, and wood. Although gear cutting is a substantial industry, many metal and plastic gears are made without cutting, by processes such as die casting or injection molding. Some metal gears made with powder metallurgy require subsequent machining, whereas others are complete after sintering. Likewise, metal or plastic gears made with additive manufacturing may or may not require finishing by cutting, depending on application. ==ProcessesBroaching=== For very large gears or spline, a vertical broach is used. It consists of a vertical rail that carries a single tooth cutter formed to create the tooth shape. A rotary table and a Y axis are the customary axes available. Some machines will cut to a depth on the Y axis and index the rotary table automatically. The largest gears are produced on these machines. Other operations such as broaching work particularly well for cutting teeth on the inside. The downside to this is that it is expensive and different broach sticks are required to make different sized gears. Therefore, it is mostly used in very high production runs. ===Hobbing=== A horizontal CNC Gear Hobbing Machine gear hobbing a spur gear to module 17dp on cnc cutting machine Hobbing is a method by which a hob is used to cut teeth into a blank. We gear hobbing with a master hob or index hob on CNC Gear Hobbing machines who cut, gears, wheels, pinions, shats and worms. The cutter and gear blank are rotated at the same time to transfer the profile of the hob onto the gear blank. Used very often for all sizes of production runs, but works best for medium to high. The hobbing features for gears are straight, helical, straight bevel, face, crowned, worm, cylkro and chamfering. ===Milling or grinding=== Spur may be cut or ground on a milling machine or jig grinder utilizing a numbered gear cutter, and any indexing head or rotary table. The number of the gear cutter is determined by the tooth count of the gear to be cut. To machine a helical gear on a manual machine, a true indexing fixture must be used. Indexing fixtures can disengage the drive worm, and be attached via an external gear train to the machine table's handle (like a power feed). It then operates similarly to a carriage on a lathe. As the table moves on the X axis, the fixture will rotate in a fixed ratio with the table. The indexing fixture itself receives its name from the original purpose of the tool: moving the table in precise, fixed increments. If the indexing worm is not disengaged from the table, one can move the table in a highly controlled fashion via the indexing plate to produce linear movement of great precision (such as a vernier scale). There are a few different types of cutters used when creating gears. One is a rack shaper. These are straight and move in a direction tangent to the gear, while the gear. They have six to twelve teeth and eventually have to be moved back to the starting point to begin another cut. ===Shaping=== The old method of gear cutting is mounting a gear blank in a shaper and using a tool shaped in the profile of the tooth to be cut. This method also works for cutting internal splines. Another is a pinion-shaped cutter that is used in a gear shaper machine. It is basically when a cutter that looks similar to a gear cuts a gear blank. The cutter and the blank must have a rotating axis parallel to each other. This process works well for low and high production runs. ===Finishing=== After being cut the gear can be finished by shaving, burnishing, grinding, honing or lapping.. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * == Further reading == * .

They create stage plays, interventions, scenic installations, and radio plays. Many of their works are characterized by interactivity and a playful use of technology. ==Background== The three met while attending the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies at University of Giessen, Hesse, Germany. They are a team of authors, directors, and designers of sound, stage, and videos, who have been working together since 1999. They have been invited three times to Berliner Theatertreffen, Germany's most important festival featuring the 10 best performances of Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. Since 2003, their projects also take place within the framework of big national theatres like Vienna's Burgtheater or the Schauspielhaus in Zurich, as well as international festivals. ==Method== Rimini Protokoll are often described as the inventors of a new form of documentary theatre, using performers who are not professional actors but rather experts or specialists in their particular spheres of life ‚Äî professionals of a theatre of the real world. So, instead of presenting actors performing characters as parts of drama texts, they present people whom they find through elaborate research and casting procedures and with whom they develop theatre performances according to their abilities and skills in order to convincingly and strongly present themselves in front of national theatre crowds. Call Cutta, one of their earlier works, was based on outsourcing: The performers or 'experts', who were employees of a call center, were located in Salt Lake City, Kolkata, India, providing the audience in Berlin with individual cellphone performances, with each call center agent guiding just one spectator solely through the remote maze of lanes of Kreuzberg, Berlin, narrating the story of Subhas Chandra Bose, an Indian revolutionarist freedom fighter. ==Awards and recognition== * 2002 ‚Äî Impulse prize for Shooting Bourbaki * 2005 ‚Äî Politik im Freien Theater festival jury prize for Mnemopark * 2005 ‚Äî nominated in Austria for the Nestroy Theatre Prize for Schwarzenbergplatz * 2007 ‚Äî M√ºlheimer Dramatikerpreis and Publikumspreis for Karl Marx: Das Kapital, Erster Band * 2007 ‚Äî Der Faust prize * 2007 ‚Äî H√∂rspiel des Monats October for Peymannbeschimpfung * 2008 ‚Äî Kulturnews Award - best play (3rd rank) for Breaking News * 2008 ‚Äî Europe Theatre Prize in Thessaloniki - New Realities category * 2008 ‚Äî H√∂rspielpreis der Kriegsblinden for Karl Marx: Das Kapital, Erster Band (also nominated for Peymannbeschimpfung) * 2009 ‚Äî honorable mention at the Prix Ars Electronica 09 (International Competition for Cyber Arts) in the category Interactive Art for Call Cutta in a box * 2011 ‚Äî Silver Lion in the 41st biennale of Venice * 2012 ‚Äî Erste Saarbr√ºcker Poetik-Dozentur for Drama * 2013 ‚Äî Children's Choice Award der Ruhrtriennale for Situation Rooms * 2013 ‚Äî Excellence Award at the 17th Japan Media Festival for Situation Rooms * 2014 ‚Äî H√∂rspiel des Monats March for Qualit√§tskontrolle * 2014 ‚Äî M√ºlheimer Dramatikerpreis/St√ºcke 2014 public prize for Qualit√§tskontrolle * 2014 ‚Äî Deutscher H√∂rspielpreis der ARD for Qualit√§tskontrolle.

He started playing guitar when he was ten. He had an older cousin who played albums for him by Charlie Christian, Tal Farlow, Django Reinhardt, and Johnny Smith. He cites Smith's Designed for You as one of the albums that meant the most to him, in addition to Sounds of Synanon by Joe Pass, Poll Winners by Barney Kessel, The Swinging Guitar of Tal Farlow, and Interpretations of Tal Farlow. While still in his teens, he worked as a guitarist in bands led by Les Elgart, Larry Elgart, Warren Covington, and Sammy Kaye. He also worked with Dan Armstrong, Lew Soloff, Lew Tabackin, and Lloyd Wells. In his twenties, he worked as a vibraphonist. He formed the band The Jazz Partners and played vibes with pianist Barry Manilow, who admired the work of Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, and Barney Kessel. Wilkins and Manilow arranged songs from Kessel's albums for their group. A copy of his first solo album, Windows (Mainstream, 1973), found its way into the hands of Buddy Rich's manager. Wilkins then became a member of the Buddy Rich septet.

In 1038, he returned with his father from exile in Naples, but they were forced out again the next year by Guaimar IV of Salerno. In 1052, they returned from an exile in Greece after Guaimar's assassination. The remaining years of John II's rule were peaceful except in regards to his relations with Gisulf II of Salerno, Guaimar's successor. Gisulf eventually made peace with John, but war broke out between Amalfi and Salerno on John's death. In 1071, Sergius (now sole ruler) was at Montecassino for the reconsecration of that great abbey. Gisulf was also present and Pope Alexander II worked out a peace between the two rulers. It lasted until Sergius' death in late 1073.

In the early 1880s, she married James Mick, with whom she had four children (one died in infancy). When James died in the late 1890s, Mick moved with her three children to Toronto, where she went to work as a matron in the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women. Her position was similar to that of a correctional officer today. In 1916, she applied for a transfer to the Toronto Municipal Jail Farm for Women in Concord. The facility was considered state of the art for its time. It put low-risk female offenders to work growing fruits and vegetables and raising livestock. == Death == On Sunday, May 25, 1925, Mick arrived for work at 8:00 PM, unaware that three inmates planned an escape. Mick would be the only staff member on duty throughout the night. At about 10:15 PM, while Mick was taking clean baby bottles to the maternity wing, 16-year-old Jennie McMinn was able to force open and squeeze through a hinged window in her cell door. Then, using a spoon that she had smuggled from the cafeteria, she forced the lock on a second inmate's cell. The two of them waited while a third complained loudly about a water leak in her cell. As Mick was opening the third inmate's cell to investigate, she was jumped from behind by the two lying in wait. She was beaten, throttled, and dragged to a small utility room and tied to pipes while unconscious. The next morning, she was found dead when the next shift came on duty, still tied spread-eagle to the pipes. The official cause of death was ruled as assault. Her three assailants were soon caught and convicted of their crimes. They each served five years in the Toronto (Don) Jail. Five other conspirators were convicted of aiding and abetting the crime and also served short sentences in the Toronto (Don) Jail. == Remembrance == During the 1st Session, 38th Parliament, on Tuesday, June 14, 2005, the Honourable Lorna Milne spoke of Margaret Mick's life and death and had this to say about the woman: > Margaret Ann Mick was an uncommon woman who showed uncommon bravery, both > personally and professionally. In a time long before the support provided by > the modern social services system, she managed to keep her family together > after her husband's death. In those days, many women were forced to give > their children up for adoption in such circumstances, but her determination > would not allow that. She built her career and kept her family close to her, > decades before that became the norm. Mick was 64 years old at the time of her death. A surprise party had been arranged for her birthday, less than a week later on June 1, 1925. She was survived by two sons, a daughter, and a sister. Mick is buried at the Union Cemetery in Waterdown, Ontario. == See also == *List of Canadian correctional workers who have died in the line of duty ==External links== *Officer Down Memorial Page *National Union Working Session report *1st Session, 38th (Canadian) Parliament, June 14, 2005 Category:1860 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Canadian prison officers Category:People from Hamilton, Ontario ","title":"Margaret Mick"},{"id":"6252131","text":"The Lindner Family Tennis Center is a tennis facility in Mason, Ohio. It is the home of the Western & Southern Open and is owned by Tennis for Charity, Inc. The grounds include four permanent tennis stadia (Center Court, Grandstand Court, Court 3 and Court 10), distinguishing the center as the only world tennis venue, apart from the four Grand Slam venues, with more than two permanent stadia. Center Court, built in 1981 and expanded many times since, has a capacity of 11,400. Grandstand Court, built in 1995, has a capacity of 5,000. Court 3, built in 2010, seats 4,000. Court 10, built in 1997 and originally named Court 3, has a capacity of 2,000. Its name, The Lindner Family Tennis Center, pays tribute to the family of a former tournament sponsor, the late Cincinnati financier, Carl Lindner, Jr. Browning Day of Indianapolis has been the architectural firm of record for the Center since its conception. ==History== The location became home to the tournament now known as the Western & Southern Open (or Cincinnati Masters) in 1979 when tournament organizers grew weary of perennial Ohio River flooding at its venue of the time, the Coney Island amusement park. One of the tournament sponsors, Taft Broadcasting, owned the Kings Island Amusement Park in Mason, as well as the Golf Center at Kings Island, which was located on land directly across Interstate 71 from the park. When the chairman of Taft Broadcasting, Charles Mechem, suggested the tournament move to land at the Golf Center, tournament organizers, led by Paul M. Flory, agreed. Four courts of DecoTurf II were initially installed at the new location, and the bleachers used at Coney Island were shipped up I-71 and placed around one of them to form Center Court. Two years later, those bleachers were removed and the first phase of construction on that court began. Enhancements to seating and amenities on Center Court have been made nearly every year since. One of the biggest expansions came in 1987 when the original West Building was added, creating working space for players and media and luxury suites for fans. An expansion in 1990 added more suites and increased capacity on Center Court to 10,000. Construction in 1998 added two additional courts, bringing the total number of courts at the Tennis Center to 10. In 2010, the Tennis Center was enhanced with a new \\"West Building,\\" now known as The Paul M. Flory Player Center in honor of the 36-year patriarch of the tournament. The new Player Center added space not only for players, but for media and fans as well. It is approximately twice as high as the previous West Building, rising above ground level and above the court level. A canopy extends over the west stands providing more covered seating. Total Center Court seating capacity was raised from 10,500 to 11,400 after the renovation. In 2011 the grounds were expanded by more than 40% and six courts were added (increasing the total number of courts from 10 to 16), including Court 3 which serves as the third television court for the tournament. The expansion also included a new front entrance, entry plaza and ticket office. Harry Ewers & Sons, Inc. was chosen to construct and maintain the facility tennis courts. In 2012, the tournament expanded the food court and exhibit areas and also enhanced the northern entrance. ==Other events== The venue also hosts the Atlantic 10 Conference Tennis Championships and the Ohio Athletic Conference Tennis Championships, and has hosted the Association of Volleyball Professionals Cincinnati professional sand volleyball tournament, special events such as concerts and Hospice of Cincinnati's annual fundraising event, and numerous national and regional high school tennis tournaments. It has also hosted the Cincinnati AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Championship Series. Starting in the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, the Ohio High School Athletic Association has announced that their state championship tournament will be held at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. The tournament was previously held at The Ohio State University and the Elysium Tennis Center. ==See also== * List of tennis stadiums by capacity ==References== From Club Court to Center Court by Phillip S.

(2010). ANU ZA Kabuki. Monsoon (pg. 26). Australian National University Asia Pacific Studies Society. Directed by Shun Ikeda of the ANU Japan Centre, with a cast and crew consisting mainly of ANU Japanese students,http://www.anuexchange.net/event.php?eid=13 the troupe performs traditional Kabuki plays almost entirely in classical Japanese, with some English translation and ad-libs inserted to assist the mainly English-speaking audiences. ==History== The tradition of annual Japanese performances at the ANU began in 1976, with the first shows taking place in the walkway between the Sports & Recreation building and the Union building. During the 1980s and 1990s, productions became increasingly elaborate, with authentic makeup and costumes, original sets and musical accompaniment, hosted at a number of the theatre facilities around the ANU campus. In 1999, Producer Suzy Styles led the Za Kabuki troupe on their first tour of Japan, with performances in Nara and Kobe. On 11 September 2001, a troupe from Kobe's Konan University returned the favour by performing at the ANU's Llewellyn Hall. The 2006 production of Yukio Mishima's Iwashiuri Koi no Hikiami, for the first time in Za Kabuki history, featured a 7-piece orchestra, also made up predominantly of ANU Japan Centre students. The orchestra played an original score, composed specifically for the play by Thomas Spencer Hartley. 2013 marked Za Kabuki's first performance in the absence of long-time director, Shun Ikeda. Instead the role of director was taken on by third-year ANU student and former kuroko, Noriyuki Yabe. Despite the timing of the performance coinciding with exam period, the 2013 performance of Kagotsurube managed to sell over four hundred tickets in a twenty-four-hour period and was greatly praised by critics. In 2016, the crew once again travelled to Japan, performing three shows in the Tohoku region, particularly in areas affected by the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami. The tour was highly successful and deepened ties between the club and communities in Akita, Kesennuma and Ishinomaki. In 2017, the group conducted a performance tour in Melbourne, performing 'Topknot Bunshichi' at two venues. The shows were received well and preceded two sell-out nights in Canberra in early October. ==Past performances== { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" ! Year ! Title !

Though its motto \\"Celebrating Women of Every Color\\" targets all women, the magazine typically covers issues from the voices of women of color, and often from a politically left-wing perspective. Tint began as a multicultural women's webzine, first published in 2004 by then college freshman Margarita L. Barry on the campus of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. Created as a response to the lack of diverse faces and voices in mainstream women's publications, the first issue of Tint was launched in PDF format online that May. Barry never intended for the magazine to be a campus publication, though a misquote in the university's weekly newspaper, The BG News, hinted otherwise. The print edition of Tint was published twice per year. Tint has been loosely linked to several subcultures and movements, including Transculturation, DIY Culture, Arts and Crafts Movement, Anarcho-punk, Afro-punk, Zine, Feminism, Black Feminism, Grassroots, and Activism. To date, Tint has featured cover stories on a unique blend of women including actress/vocalist Alisa Reyes, actress/vocalist Persia White, and recording artist Goapele, all celebrities of multiethnic heritages with notable grassroots arts or activism involvement. In addition to celebrity interviews, Tint also regularly features stories on everyday women who are making their own individual impacts on the world. The publication maintains a small but relevant cross-cultural readership and following. Tint is rumored to be taking a more local slant in the year 2007, incorporating both digital and print editions. ==References *Tint Magazine‚Ä≤s Official Site *Team Tint Yahoo Group *ColoredgURL.com Affiliate Site/Parent Host Category:African-American magazines Category:Biannual magazines published in the United States Category:Fanzines Category:Fashion magazines published in the United States Category:Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Magazines published in Detroit Category:Magazines published in Ohio Category:Political magazines published in the United States Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Women's magazines published in the United States ","title":"Tint (magazine)"},{"id":"6252141","text":"Cladosporium is a genus of fungi including some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Species produce olive-green to brown or black colonies, and have dark-pigmented conidia that are formed in simple or branching chains. Many species of Cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium spores are wind-dispersed and they are often extremely abundant in outdoor air. Indoors Cladosporium species may grow on surfaces when moisture is present. Cladosporium fulvum, cause of tomato leaf mould, has been an important genetic model, in that the genetics of host resistance are understood. In the 1960s, it was estimated that the genus Cladosporium contained around 500 plant-pathogenic and saprotrophic species, but this number has since been increased to over 772 species. The genus Cladosporium is very closely related to black yeasts in the order Dothideales. Cladosporium species are often highly osmotolerant, growing easily on media containing 10% glucose or 12‚Äì17% NaCl. They are rarely grown on media containing 24% NaCl or 50% glucose and never isolated from medium with 32% NaCl or greater. Most species have very fragile spore chains, making it extremely difficult to prepare a mount for microscopic observation in which the conidial chains are preserved intact. == Health effects == Cladosporium species are rarely pathogenic to humans, but have been reported to cause infections of the skin and toenails as well as sinuses and lungs. The airborne spores of Cladosporium species are significant allergens, and in large amounts they can severely affect asthmatics and people with respiratory diseases. Cladosporium species produce no major mycotoxins of concern, but do produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with odours. == Species == *C. acaciicola *C. acalyphae *C. adianticola *C. aecidiicola *C. agoseridis *C. albiziae *C. algarum *C. allicinum *C. allii *C. allii-porri *C. alliicola *C. alneum *C. alopecuri *C. alternicoloratum *C. angustisporum *C. antarcticum *C. antillanum *C. aphidis *C. apicale *C. aristolochiae *C. aromaticum *C. arthoniae *C. arthrinioides *C. arthropodii *C. asperistipitatum *C. asperulatum *C. atriellum *C. atroseptum *C. auriculae *C. australiense *C. baccae *C. balladynae *C. banaticum *C. basi-inflatum *C. bauhiniana *C. boenninghauseniae *C. borassi *C. bosciae *C. brachormium *C. brachyelytri *C. brassicae *C. brassicicola *C. brevicatenulatum *C. brevipes *C. breviramosum *C. brunneoatrum *C. brunneolum *C. brunneum *C. buchananiae *C. buteicola *C. butyri *C. caraganae *C. carpesii *C. caryigenum *C. cassiae-surathensis *C. castellanii *C. chalastosporoides *C. chamaeropis *C. cheonis *C. chlamydeum *C. chrysanthemi *C. chrysophylli *C. chubutense *C. circaea *C. citri *C. cladosporioides *C. colocasiae *C. colocasiicola *C. colombiae *C. confusum *C. coralloides *C. coryphae *C. cucumerinum *C. cycadacearum *C. cyrtomii *C. desmodicola *C. dianellicola *C. diaphanum *C. digitalicola *C. dominicanum *C. dracaenatum *C. edgeworthiae *C. elegans *C. elsinoes *C. epimyces *C. epiphyllum *C. erianthi *C. eriolobi *C. exasperatum *C. exile *C. exobasidii *C. extorre *C. ferox *C. festucae *C. flabelliforme *C. foliorum *C. forsythiae *C. fraxinicola *C. fuligineum *C. fumagineum *C. funiculosum *C. fusiforme *C. galii *C. gallicola *C. gamsianum *C. geniculatum *C. gerwasiae *C. globisporum *C. glochidionis *C. gloeosporioides *C. gossypiicola *C. grevilleae *C. grumosum *C. gynoxidicola *C. halotolerans *C. haplophylli *C. harknessii *C. heleophilum *C. helicosporum *C. heliotropii *C. herbaroides *C. herbarum *C. heterophragmatis *C. heuglinianum *C. hillianum *C. hordei *C. humile *C. hydrangeae *C. indicum *C. indigoferae *C. inopinum *C. inversicolor *C. iranicum *C. jacarandicola *C. juglandinum *C. kapildharens *C. lacroixii *C. ladinum *C. langeronii *C. laxicapitulatum *C. leguminicola *C. leprosum *C. licheniphilum *C. linicola *C. liriodendri *C. lonicericola *C. lophodermii *C. lupiniphilum *C. machili *C. macrocarpum *C. magnusianum *C. malvacearum *C. manoutchehrii *C. melospermae *C. metaplexis *C. milii *C. mimulicola *C. minourae *C. molle *C. murorum *C. musae *C. myriosporum *C. myrtacearum *C. myrticola *C. neocheiropteridis *C. neottopteridis *C. neriicola *C. nigrelloides *C. nigrellum *C. nitrariae *C. nodulosum *C. obtectum *C. oncobae *C. orchidearum *C. orchidiphilum *C. orchidis *C. oreodaphnes *C. ossifragi *C. ovorum *C. oxycocci *C. oxysporum *C. pallidum *C. paracladosporioides *C. perangustum *C. pericarpium *C. peruamazonicum *C. phaenocomae *C. phlei *C. phlei-pratensis *C. phyllachorae *C. phyllactiniicola *C. phyllogenum *C. phyllophilum *C. pini-ponderosae *C. pipericola *C. pisi *C. platycodonis *C. polygonati *C. polymorphosporum *C. populicola *C. praecox *C. psammicola *C. pseudiridis *C. pseudocladosporioides *C. psidiicola *C. psoraleae *C. psychrotolerans *C. punctulatum *C. ramotenellum *C. ramulosum *C. rectangulare *C. rectoides *C. rhododendri *C. robiniae *C. rutae *C. salicis-sitchensis *C. salinae *C. sarmentorum *C. scabrellum *C. silenes *C. sinuosum *C. smilacicola *C. soldanellae *C. sorghi *C. sphaeroideum *C. sphaerospermum *C. spinaciarum *C. spinulosum *C. spongiosum *C. straminicola *C. strobilanthis *C. subinflatum *C. subnodosum *C. subobtectum *C. subsessile *C. subtilissimum *C. subuliforme *C. syringae *C. syringicola *C. tectonicola *C. tenellum *C. tenuissimum *C. tetrapanacis *C. typhae *C. typharum *C. uleanum *C. uniseptosporum *C. uredinicola *C. uredinis *C. varians *C. velox *C. velutinum *C. verrucocladosporioides *C. victorialis *C. vignae *C. vincicola *C. xylophilum *C. xyridis *C. yuccae *C. zeae *C. ziziphi == References  External links == * Category:Dothideomycetes genera Category:Fungal plant pathogens and diseases Category:Allergology ","title":"Cladosporium"},{"id":"6252148","text":"John III or John IV (the enumeration of Amalfitan rulers has never been standardised) was the duke of Amalfi briefly in 1073 by right of succession following the death of his father, Sergius III, in November.

The film, produced by Shaftesbury Films, aired as a television movie on CTV in 2005. It was written by Dennis Foon and directed by Don McBrearty, and was created in part because the earlier 1983 film The Terry Fox Story had been criticized by Fox's family for inaccurately depicting his personality. Shawn Ashmore portrays Fox. Unlike Eric Fryer, who previously portrayed Fox in The Terry Fox Story, Ashmore is not an amputee. For some scenes, a real amputee body double was used, while in others, digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over Ashmore's real leg. The film's cast also includes Matt Gordon as Fox's publicist Bill Vigars, Catherine Disher and David Huband as Fox's parents Betty and Rolly, and Noah Reid as his brother Darrell. The film concludes with a mixed montage of footage of the actual Terry Fox and the film version to the music of \\"Turnaround\\" by Stan Rogers. __TOC__ ==Cast== *Shawn Ashmore as Terry Fox *Ryan McDonald as Doug Alward *Noah Reid as Darrell Fox *Matt Gordon as Bill Vigars *Catherine Disher as Betty Fox *David Huband as Rolly Fox *Adam Butcher as Chad *David Keeley as Bobby Orr *Shannon Lawson as Mrs. Jones == Background == Terry is based on Terry Fox, who had cancer in his legs, leading to one of his legs being amputated. He embarked on a 143 day run, covering 5,373 kilometres across Canada. After 10 months of his marathon, Fox died on June 28, 1981. He left the legacy of the Terry Fox Run in over 60 countries which has raised more than $360 million for cancer research. Canada has honoured Fox's name by putting him on a stamp, in fact, he was the first person in Canadian history to be put on a stamp without being dead for 10 years. Canada also commemorated him by putting him on a collective dollar in 2005. == Production == Terry was directed by Emmy Award winning Don McBrearty. The TV movie cost $4 million to produce and took a duration of 21 days to film, over the summer. The cast and crew quickly learned the struggles that Fox went through during his marathon. In an article published by The Globe and Mail McBrearty stated, \\"We filmed in intense heat and we were exhausted just trying to retrace his steps. And we didn't run the daily marathon that Terry did. He started most mornings at 5 and went to bed by 8 o'clock. But as events progressed and he got into Ontario, when he became more popular, he had to go to receptions, sometimes two or three in a night. None of us can figure out how he did it, running 26 miles every day. It's hard to fathom.\\" Shawn Ashmore who depicts Terry Fox in the film also went through difficulties trying to portray Fox accurately. Due to Fox only having one leg and a prosthetic leg, Ashmore's leg was removed in post production digitally. He stated in the same article from The Globe and Mail that, \\"The roughest part is the physicality, learning the skip-hop to make it real, and remembering and knowing the movement.\\" He has stated that didn't want to harm Fox's legacy and did so by training very hard and getting into shape for all of the running that would be required for filming. == Release == Terry was released in Canada on September 11, 2005. It was also released in Hungary on the 21st of September in 2006 and in the UK on February 25th in 2007. == References  * Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films Category:2000s biographical drama films Category:Canadian biographical drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian television films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:English-language films Category:Films about amputees Category:Athletics films Category:Running films Category:Biographical films about sportspeople Category:Cultural depictions of track and field athletes Category:Cultural depictions of Canadian men Category:Films about cancer Category:Terry Fox Category:2005 drama films Category:2006 drama films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Terry (film)"},{"id":"6252173","text":"Kevin Cywinski (born March 16, 1965) is a former NASCAR driver. He competed in the Craftsman Truck Series full-time in 1998 and 1999, as well as some races in the Busch Series. After leaving NASCAR, he went back down to the short- track ranks. He won the ASA championship series in 2004. He is currently a co- owner of Win-Tron Racing. ==Craftsman Truck Series== Cywinski made his debut in this series in 1997, when he competed in the #18 Dana Holding Corporation Dodge. His first race was at ORP, where Cywinski started 21st and finished a respectable 20th. Later in the year, Cywinski started 20th at Mesa Marin and came home with a solid 15th-place finish. Those runs attracted the eyes of Bob Brevak, who hired Cywinski after released Tony Roper midway through 1998. Cywinski got right on it, earning an 8th-place finish in his first outing with the team at Bristol. However, Cywinski struggled for the rest of the year, only recording five top-20 finishes in nineteen races. Cywinski did not finish nine races, but seven of those were mechanical failure. Still, they did not help the team. The main highlight of Cywinski's year was winning the outside pole at Flemington. This was all en route to a 28th-place finish in points. Brevak stood with Cywinski and his trust was greatly paid in 1999, as Cywinski roared to a 16th-place finish in points after two top-5s and seven top-10s. His best run of the season was a 3rd at Bristol, followed closely by a 4th at Martinsville and the other five top-10s. Cywinski would have proved to be a bigger threat in the points, but his team struggled at some tracks, posting a season average 17.8 finish. Cywinski left after the year was up to go back short track racing and was replaced by John Young. ==Busch Series== Cywinski made two career starts in this series, both coming in 1998. Cywinski debuted in the Ruark Racing #89 Chevy at Hickory. The short track ace qualified the car in 29th, but steadily improved to 19th in the final showing. Key Motorsports was the team that Cywinski drove for next at Richmond. He started that event in 19th, but slid to 25th in the final rundown. ==Motorsports career resultsNASCAR=== (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. The Landau levels are degenerate, with the number of electrons per level directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. Landau quantization is directly responsible for oscillations in electronic properties of materials as a function of the applied magnetic field. It is named after the Soviet physicist Lev LandauLandau, L. D. (1930). Diamagnetism of Metals. Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik, 64(9-10), 629-637.. ==Derivation== Consider a system of non-interacting particles with charge and spin confined to an area in the plane. Apply a uniform magnetic field \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\B\\\\end{pmatrix} along the -axis. In CGS units, the Hamiltonian of this system (Here, the effects of spin are neglected. Consideration of spin introduces an additional term to the Hamiltonian operator) is :\\\\hat{H}=\\\\frac{1}{2m}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}-q\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}}/c)^2. Here, \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}} is the canonical momentum operator and \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}} is the electromagnetic vector potential, which is related to the magnetic field by :\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}}. \\\\, There is some gauge freedom in the choice of vector potential for a given magnetic field. The Hamiltonian is gauge invariant, which means that adding the gradient of a scalar field to √Ç changes the overall phase of the wave function by an amount corresponding to the scalar field. But physical properties are not influenced by the specific choice of gauge. For simplicity in calculation, choose the Landau gauge, which is :\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}}= \\\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\\\\\\\\\Bx \\\\\\\\\\\\0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. where =B and xÃÇ is the component of the position operator. In this gauge, the Hamiltonian is :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left(\\\\hat{p}_y - \\\\frac{qB\\\\hat{x}}{c}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}_z^2}{2m}. The operator \\\\hat{p}_y commutes with this Hamiltonian, since the operator yÃÇ is absent by the choice of gauge. Thus the operator \\\\hat{p}_y can be replaced by its eigenvalue . Since \\\\hat{z} does not appear in the Hamiltonian and only the z-momentum appears in the kinetic energy, this motion along the z-direction is a free motion. The Hamiltonian can also be written more simply by noting that the cyclotron frequency is , giving :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega_c^2 \\\\left( \\\\hat{x} - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar k_y}{m\\\\omega_c} \\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}_z^2}{2m}. This is exactly the Hamiltonian for the quantum harmonic oscillator, except with the minimum of the potential shifted in coordinate space by . To find the energies, note that translating the harmonic oscillator potential does not affect the energies. The energies of this system are thus identical to those of the standard quantum harmonic oscillatorLandau, L. D., & Lifshitz, E. M., (1981). Quantum Mechanics; Non-relativistic Theory. 3rd edition. Butterworth- Heinemann. pp. 424-426., :E_n=\\\\hbar\\\\omega_c\\\\left(n+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{p_z^2}{2m},\\\\quad n\\\\geq 0~. The energy does not depend on the quantum number , so there will be a finite number of degeneracies (If the particle is placed in an unconfined space, this degeneracy will correspond to a continuous sequence of p_y). The value of p_z is continuous if the particle is unconfined in the z-direction and discrete if the particle is bounded in the z-direction also. For the wave functions, recall that \\\\hat{p}_y commutes with the Hamiltonian. Then the wave function factors into a product of momentum eigenstates in the direction and harmonic oscillator eigenstates \\\\phi_n\\\\rangle shifted by an amount 0 in the direction: :\\\\Psi(x,y)=e^{i(k_y y+k_z z)} \\\\phi_n(x-x_0) where k_z=p_z/\\\\hbar. In sum, the state of the electron is characterized by the quantum numbers, , and . ===Landau levels=== Each set of wave functions with the same value of is called a Landau level. Effects of Landau levels are only observed when the mean thermal energy is smaller than the energy level separation, , meaning low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Each Landau level is degenerate because of the second quantum number , which can take the values :k_y = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi N}{L_y}, where is an integer. The allowed values of are further restricted by the condition that the center of force of the oscillator, , must physically lie within the system, . This gives the following range for , :0 \\\\leq N < \\\\frac{m \\\\omega_c L_x L_y}{2\\\\pi\\\\hbar}. For particles with charge , the upper bound on can be simply written as a ratio of fluxes, :\\\\frac{Z B L_x L_y}{(hc/e)} = Z\\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{\\\\Phi_0}, where is the fundamental quantum of flux and is the flux through the system (with area ). Thus, for particles with spin , the maximum number of particles per Landau level is :D = Z (2S+1) \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{\\\\Phi_0}~, which for electrons (where =1 and =1/2) gives , two available states for each flux quantum that penetrates the system. The above gives only a rough idea of the effects of finite-size geometry. Strictly speaking, using the standard solution of the harmonic oscillator is only valid for systems unbounded in the -direction (infinite strips). If the size is finite, boundary conditions in that direction give rise to non-standard quantization conditions on the magnetic field, involving (in principle) both solutions to the Hermite equation. The filling of these levels with many electrons is still an active area of research. In general, Landau levels are observed in electronic systems. As the magnetic field is increased, more and more electrons can fit into a given Landau level. The occupation of the highest Landau level ranges from completely full to entirely empty, leading to oscillations in various electronic properties (see de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect and Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect). If Zeeman splitting is included, each Landau level splits into a pair, one for spin up electrons and the other for spin down electrons. Then the occupation of each spin Landau level is just the ratio of fluxes = . Zeeman splitting has a significant effect on the Landau levels because their energy scales are the same, . However, the Fermi energy and ground state energy stay roughly the same in a system with many filled levels, since pairs of split energy levels cancel each other out when summed. Discussion This derivation treats and y as slightly asymmetric. However, by the symmetry of the system, there is no physical quantity which distinguishes these coordinates. The same result could have been obtained with an appropriate interchange of and . Moreover, the above derivation assumed an electron confined in the -direction, which is a relevant experimental situation ‚Äî found in two-dimensional electron gases, for instance. Still, this assumption is not essential for the results. If electrons are free to move along the direction, the wave function acquires an additional multiplicative term exp(); the energy corresponding to this free motion, , is added to the discussed. This term then fills in the separation in energy of the different Landau levels, blurring the effect of the quantization. Nevertheless, the motion in the --plane, perpendicular to the magnetic field, is still quantized. ===Landau levels in symmetric gauge=== The symmetric gauge refers to the choice :\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}} =\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\begin{pmatrix} -By\\\\\\\\\\\\ Bx \\\\\\\\\\\\0 \\\\end{pmatrix} In terms of dimensionless lengths and energies, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[\\\\left(-i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(-i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right] The correct units can be restored by introducing factors of q, c, \\\\hbar, \\\\mathbf{B} and m Consider operators :\\\\hat{a} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right) -i \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)\\\\right] :\\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right) +i \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)\\\\right] :\\\\hat{b} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right) +i \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)\\\\right] :\\\\hat{b}^{\\\\dagger} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right) -i \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)\\\\right] These operators follow certain commutation relations :[\\\\hat{a}, \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger}] = [\\\\hat{b},\\\\hat{b}^{\\\\dagger}] = 1. In terms of above operators the Hamiltonian can be written as : \\\\hat{H} = \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{a} + \\\\frac{1}{2} Landau Level index n is the eigenvalue of \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{a} The z component of angular momentum is :\\\\hat{L}_z = -i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = - \\\\hbar (\\\\hat{b}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{b} - \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{a}) Exploiting the property [\\\\hat{H}, \\\\hat{L}_z] = 0 we chose eigenfunctions which diagonalize \\\\hat{H} and \\\\hat{L}_z, The eigenvalue of \\\\hat{L}_z is denoted by \\\\- m \\\\hbar, where it is clear that m \\\\ge -n in the nth Landau level. However, it may be arbitrarily large, which is necessary to obtain the infinite degeneracy (or finite degeneracy per unit area) exhibited by the system. The application of \\\\hat{b}^{\\\\dagger} increases m by one unit while preserving n, whereas \\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger} application simultaneously increase n and decreases m by one unit. The analogy to quantum harmonic oscillator provides solutions :\\\\hat{H} n,m\\\\rangle = E_n n,m\\\\rangle :E_n = \\\\hbar\\\\omega_c\\\\left(n + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right) :n,m\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{(\\\\hat{b}^{\\\\dagger})^{m+n}}{\\\\sqrt{(m+n)!}} \\\\frac{(\\\\hat{a}^{\\\\dagger})^{n}}{\\\\sqrt{n!}}0,0\\\\rangle Each Landau level has degenerate orbitals labeled by the quantum numbers and m in the Landau and symmetric gauges respectively. The degeneracy per unit area is the same in each Landau level. One may verify that the above states correspond to choosing wavefunctions proportional to :\\\\psi_{n,m}(x, y) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial w} - \\\\frac{\\\\bar{w}}{4} \\\\right)^n w^{n + m} e^{-w^2 / 4} where w = x + i y. In particular, the lowest Landau level n = 0 consists of arbitrary analytic functions multiplying a Gaussian, \\\\psi(x,y) = f(w) e^{-w^2/4}. ==Effects of gauge transformation== :\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{A}' = \\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{x}) The definition for kinematical momenta is :\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi} = \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}-q\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{A}}/c where \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}} are the canonical momenta. The Hamiltonian is a gauge invariant so \\\\langle\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi}\\\\rangle and \\\\langle \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\rangle will remain invariant under gauge transformations but \\\\langle\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\rangle will depend upon gauge. For observing the effect of gauge transformation on the quantum state of the particle, consider the state with A and A' as vector Potential, with states \\\\alpha\\\\rangle and \\\\alpha'\\\\rangle. As \\\\langle \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\rangle and \\\\langle\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi}\\\\rangle is invariant under the gauge transformation we get :\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf x}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\alpha'\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf x}\\\\alpha'\\\\rangle :\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\alpha'\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\pi}'\\\\alpha'\\\\rangle :\\\\langle\\\\alpha\\\\alpha\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\alpha'\\\\alpha'\\\\rangle Consider an operator \\\\mathcal{G} such that \\\\alpha'\\\\rangle = \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\alpha\\\\rangle from above relation we deduce that :\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf x}\\\\mathcal{G} = \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf x} :\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf p} - \\\\frac{e\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A}}{c} - \\\\frac{e\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf x)}{c}\\\\right)\\\\mathcal{G} = \\\\hat{p} - \\\\frac{e\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf A}}{c} :\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\mathcal{G} = 1 from this we conclude :\\\\mathcal{G} = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{ie\\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\hbar c}\\\\right) ==Magnetic susceptibility of a Fermi gas== The most important example of a Fermi gas of electrons. Such Fermi gases are part of the basis for understanding the physical properties of metals. In 1939 Landau derived an estimate for the magnetic susceptibility of a Fermi gas, known as Landau susceptibility, which is constant for small magnetic fields. Landau also noticed that the susceptibility oscillates with high frequency for large magnetic fields,, this physical phenomenon is known as the de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect. == Two- dimensional lattice == The tight binding energy spectrum of charged particles in a two dimensional infinite lattice is know to be self-similar and fractal, as demonstrated in Hofstadter's butterfly. For an integer ratio of the magnetic flux quantum and the magnetic flux through a lattice cell, one recovers the Landau levels for large integers. ==See also== *Barkhausen effect *de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect *Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect *Quantum Hall effect *Laughlin wavefunction *Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Landau, L.

The new building was built behind the previous building and offered considerably more space, with one hundred beds. It was designed by JB & W. Atkinson. In 1887, the hospital merged with the York Eye Institution which had been opened in 1875, but which was being rarely used. A nurses‚Äô home was built in 1905. York suffered a major attack on 29 April 1942, one of the Baedeker raids by the Luftwaffe. Many of the casualties, who would later go on to die, were treated at York County Hospital. In 1977 the hospital facilities moved to York Hospital which had six hundred beds; the ante-natal clinic remained on-site until 1980. The Sainsbury's supermarket at Jewbury was then built while the hospital building, renamed County House, was used as the headquarters of Yorkshire Water before being converted for residential use. ==People linked with the hospital== *Francis Drake, surgeon 1740-1745 *John Burton, physician and man midwife 1740-1746\\"Burton, John (1697-1771)\\".

Renzi faced ethical problems in this election and was named by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington as one of the most corrupt candidates running for office that year. Attorney and community activist Ellen Simon emerged as the Democratic nominee and, though she trailed Renzi by wide margins, initially, made up much of the lost ground and closed the gap, causing many to consider the race competitive. Ultimately, though, Renzi won re-election by an eight- point margin. ==District 2== thumb This heavily conservative and gerrymandered congressional district owes its strange shape to the decision to not have Hopi and Navajo Native Americans represented by the same congressman due to historic tensions between them. Republican Congressman Trent Franks has represented this district since his initial election in 2002 and has managed comfortable re-elections due to the conservative nature of the Phoenix suburbs that the district pulls from. This year proved to be no different, when Congressman Franks defeated Democratic challenger John Thrasher, albeit by a smaller margin than usual. ==District 3== thumb This staunchly conservative district, based in the northern portion of Phoenix and its northern suburbs, has been represented by incumbent Republican Congressman John Shadegg since his initial election in 1994. This year, Congressman Shadegg faced Democratic nominee Herb Paine, a consultant, in the general election. True to the district‚Äôs conservative nature, Shadegg defeated Paine by a wide margin, though it was significantly reduced from his 2004 re-election. ==District 4== thumb This heavily liberal district, based in the southern portion of Phoenix and its southern suburbs, has a high Hispanic-American population. Incumbent Democratic Congressman Ed Pastor has represented this portion of the state since a special election in 1991 to replace the late Mo Udall. In 2006, Congressman Pastor faced Don Karg, the Republican nominee and an aerospace executive, and Donald Harders, the Libertarian write-in candidate. ==District 5== thumb This conservative-leaning district includes a small portion of Phoenix and many of its northeastern suburbs, such as Scottsdale and Tempe. Congressman J. D. Hayworth has represented this area since his initial election in 1994 and many considered him to be vulnerable to a Democratic challenger. Harry Mitchell, a former Mayor of Tempe, State Senator, and Chairman of the Democratic Party of Arizona, emerged as the Democrats‚Äô leading challenger to Hayworth. Though the race was close for much of the fall, Mitchell ultimately edged out Hayworth on election day by a four-point margin and was elected to his first term in Congress. ==District 6== thumb This heavily conservative district based in the eastern suburbs of Phoenix has been represented by Republican Congressman Jeff Flake since his initial election in 2000. Congressman Flake built up a repertoire in Congress as being a staunch fiscal conservative and an anti-earmark advocate. This year, Flake faced no Democratic opponent and was overwhelmingly re-elected to his fourth term in Congress over Libertarian candidate Jason Blair. ==District 7== thumb This district, based in southwestern Arizona and covering much of the state‚Äôs border with Mexico, has a majority Hispanic-American population and has been represented by Democratic Congressman Ra√∫l Grijalva since 2003. This year, Congressman Grijalva faced the former Mayor of Avondale, Republican Ron Drake, and Libertarian write-in candidate Joe Cobb. Grijalva defeated both Drake and Cobb, as expected, by a comfortable margin. ==District 8== thumb Long-serving Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe, a respected moderate and an openly gay man, declined to seek a seventh term in Congress and thus created an open seat. This marginally conservative district based in southeastern Arizona narrowly supported George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and the election was considered to be competitive. Former State Representative Randy Graf, a far-right conservative who had challenged Kolbe in the Republican primary in 2004, and former State Senator Gabrielle Giffords, a moderate Democrat, faced off against each other in the general election. Giffords was the tentative favorite for most of the election, as many moderates were turned off by Graf‚Äôs conservative views and Kolbe did not endorse him as the Republican candidate. On election day, Giffords emerged victorious over Graf by a comfortable twelve-point margin and won her first term in Congress. ==ReferencesSee also== 2006 United States House of Representatives Arizona ","title":"2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona"},{"id":"6252316","text":"David Rankin is a New York-based Australian artist. He works predominantly in oil painting and acrylic on canvas, but also works with paper, prints, sculptures and ceramics. Rankin has held over 100 one-person exhibitions in cities across the world and his work forms part of many of the world's leading collections and museums.Bio from Andre Zarre gallery site ==Life== David Rankin was born in Plymouth, Devon, England in 1946 then emigrated to Australia with his family in 1948. He spent his childhood in the 1950s in the semi-rural Port Hacking region South of Sydney and his teenage years in country New South Wales, from Hay, Wagga Wagga and Albury in the South to Bourke and Brewarrina in the North. Rankin is self-taught, developing his techniques and ideas in the outback towns of his youth. He was inspired by the greats from Leonardo da Vinci to Paul Klee as well as being influenced by the history of Buddhism and Asian art. In his travels before he arrived in Sydney in 1967 he developed a concept of what he wanted to achieve as an Australian artist. His dream was to express the anima, the life spirit or the essence of God in all nature. As an Australian artist he believed could bring the elements of Western Art together with an understanding and love for the cultures of Asia and the Australian Aborigine. He also felt that as Australia was closer to Asia than Europe it made sense to think about the art of Indian, Chinese and Japanese artists, and that one could not be an authentic articulate Australian artist without a love and respect for the artistic and spiritual expressions of the various Aboriginal peoples and cultures. In Sydney Rankin had his first exhibition through Watters gallery at age 22. ==Personal== In 1979 his first wife, Jennifer Mary Roberts (n√©e Haynes) died. Rankin subsequently met his current wife Lily Brett, whose own life was etched by tragedy with her parents being survivors of the Holocaust. She too migrated to Australia as a child after the Second World War in 1948. The artist recounts that his empathy for Lily and the pity for his first wife's death fused into what he calls \\"the dark blessing of my life.\\" The darkness was transformed into images. The author Dore Ashton writes that the events of 1979 and the fire which ravished his studio in 1997 and burnt his art works and many personal possessions, had a profound impact on his work. Having personal life experiences as his subject matter, Rankin's paintings contemplate these things. For example, his Jerusalem series followed a trip to Jerusalem in 1988, which then led to his Golgotha works. His travels to the Australian, American and Mexican deserts became the subject matter for many of his canvases, such as Ridge ‚Äì Mungo, Golden Prophecy ‚Äì San Antonio, Grey Sonora Landscape and then led to his Witness Series. From the fire in his studio he then painted Buddha and Flames. He illustrated two books by Lily Brett on the holocaust and explored the theme further in his huge work The Drowned and The Saved from a book by Primo Levi of the same name. Through Brett he encountered Jewish mythology and painted Black Menorah and Black Tfiln and as a testament to his love for her created his Husband and Wife Series including Husband and Wife Triptych III, and Husband and Wife ‚Äì Ying and Yang. In 1989 Rankin moved with his wife to New York City. From their home in New York they continue to explore both their Australian roots and culture and the opportunities and challenges of being part of an international community. Their three children, including celebrated artist Jessica Rankin, also live in New York. David's daughter-in-law is artist Julie Mehretu. ==Career== In the past 30 years Rankin has held over 100 one-person exhibitions in cities including Paris, Beijing, New York, Cologne and throughout Australia. He is represented in many of the world's leading collections and museums. He was selected as Australia's official representative in the UNESCO Fortieth Anniversary Exhibition celebrations that toured the world's capitals. He was featured in the Salon de Mai in Paris and the Chicago Art Fair. Among the many prizes and awards he has been honored with is the 1983 Wynne Prize, Australia's premier landscape prize. Recently an English-German monograph on his work titled \\"The Walls of the Heart: The Work and Life of David Rankin\\" was published by US critic and art historian Dore Ashton. In 2005-2006 a major exhibition of Rankin's art, curated by Dore Ashton, toured through public galleries in Australia. Among his many commissioned works are The Scorched Earth, 1984‚Äì85, oil on canvas, diptych at the Victorian Arts Centre, Melbourne. The Committee for Bosnia, commissioned a poster, A Day for Bosnia, at The University of Chicago. His oil paintings, large watercolours and ceramics appear at the New York Vista Hotel. In September 2013, a book by Dore Ashton on David Rankin's work titled David Rankin: The New York Years was released. ==See also== * List of Australian artists * Jessica Rankin - artist, David Rankin's daughter. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Brenson, Michael: \\"David Rankin\\", The New York Times, New York City, 21 December 1990; p39 *Carrier, David: \\"David Rankin‚Äôs Jerusalem Paintings\\", in the catalogue for David Rankin, The Jerusalem Paintings, Ruggiero Gallery, New York City, 1989 *Handy, Ellen: \\"Light of Australia, Walls of Jerusalem\\", Arts Magazine, New York City.

Blake was the second African American to perform a Medal of Honor action; William Harvey Carney was the first. Blake was the first African American to actually receive a Medal of Honor - his was presented to him in 1864, while Carney did not receive his until 1900. But, because Carney's Medal of Honor action occurred first, Carney, not Blake, is usually credited with being the first African American Medal of Honor recipient. ==Biography== Robert Blake was born into slavery in Virginia. In June 1862, his owner's plantation was burned during a Union naval expedition up the Santee River. About 400 slaves from the plantation, including Robert Blake, were taken as contraband onto Union ships and sent to North Island in Winyah Bay. While on North Island, Robert Blake answered a call for twenty single men to serve on the .Hanna, pp. 17-18Blake's Medal of Honor citation incorrectly gives his place of enlistment as Virginia By December 25, 1863, Blake had been transferred to the gunboat and was serving as a steward to Lieutenant Commander Richard Worsam Meade. Early that morning, in the Stono River, the Marblehead came under fire from a Confederate howitzer at Legareville on Johns Island. As Lieutenant Commander Meade jumped from his bed and ran onto the quarter deck to give the order to return fire, Blake followed behind him, handed him his uniform, and urged him to change out of his night clothes. Blake then went to the ship's gun deck and was immediately knocked down by an exploding Confederate shell. The explosion had killed a powder-boy manning one of the guns. Blake had no assigned combat role and could have retreated to relative safety below decks, but he instead chose to take over the powder boy's duties. He stripped to the waist and began running powder boxes to the gun loaders. When Lieutenant Commander Mead asked him what he was doing, he replied \\"Went down to the rocks to hide my face, but the rocks said there is no hiding place here. So here I am, Sir.\\" The Confederates eventually abandoned their position, leaving a gun behind. For his actions during the firefight, Blake was awarded the Medal of Honor four months later, on April 16, 1864. Blake was later promoted to seaman and re- enlisted for another term in the Navy. During his second enlistment, he served again on the USS Vermont. Nothing is known of his further life.Hanna, p. 19 ==Medal of Honor citation== Rank and organization: Contraband, U.S. Navy.

The teams have also been nicknamed the Ramblin' Wreck, Engineers, Blacksmiths, and Golden Tornado. There are eight men's and seven women's teams that compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I athletics and the Football Bowl Subdivision. Georgia Tech is a member of the Coastal Division in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The official school colors for Georgia Tech are tech gold and white. Navy blue is often used as a secondary color and for alternate jerseys while black has been used on rare occasion. The traditional rival in all sports is in-state University of Georgia. This rivalry is often referred to as Clean, Old- Fashioned Hate. There are also rivalries with out-of-state Auburn and official conference rival Clemson. The athletic department is run by the Georgia Tech Athletic Association, a private organization located on campus. The department dedicates about $53 million per year to its sports teams and facilities. Since November 28, 2016 the athletic director of Georgia Tech has been Todd Stansbury, who replaced Mike Bobinski after the latter left for the same position at Purdue. Most athletic teams have on-campus facilities for competition, including Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field for football, the McCamish Pavilion at Cremins' Court for men's and women's basketball, and Russ Chandler Stadium for baseball. Georgia Tech was a founding member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1895. Georgia Tech was one of the 14 schools that split to found the Southern Conference in 1921. Thirteen schools including Georgia Tech split in 1932 to form the Southeastern Conference. The Yellow Jackets left the SEC in 1964 and remained independent until becoming a founding member of the Metro-6 Conference in 1975. Georgia Tech moved to the ACC in 1978 and began competition within the ACC in 1979. == Sports sponsored == {  style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\" - -  Baseball  Basketball -  Basketball  Cross country -  Cross country  Softball -  Football  Swimming and diving -  Golf  Tennis -  Swimming and diving  Track and field‚Ä† -  Tennis  Volleyball -  Track and field‚Ä†  -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"\\"  } The Georgia Institute of Technology sponsors teams in eight men's and seven women's NCAA sanctioned sports. Georgia Tech is the only Power Five school that does not sponsor women's soccer. === Football === The first Georgia Tech football team Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field The football team is traditionally the most popular at the Institute. The games are played at Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field or simply The Flats, which is the oldest on-campus stadium in Division I FBS football. The stadium was expanded in recent years, increasing the maximum capacity to 55,000. Georgia Tech plays an Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division schedule in addition to yearly cross divisional games against Clemson and two other Atlantic Division teams. In addition, the team has a yearly out-of-conference meeting with Georgia at the end of the season known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The football team is in the top 20 winningest Division I-A programs and was the first team to win all four of the historical big four bowls ‚Äì the Rose (1929), Orange (1940), Sugar (1944), and Cotton (1955). Georgia Tech has won four national titles in the years 1917 going 9‚Äì0 under John Heisman outscoring opponents 419‚Äì17, 1928 going 10‚Äì0 under William Alexander outscoring opponents 221‚Äì47, 1952 going 12‚Äì0 under Bobby Dodd outscoring opponents 325‚Äì59, and 1990 going 11‚Äì0‚Äì1 under Bobby Ross outscoring opponents 379‚Äì186.

Paul Johnson and Georgia Tech won the 2009 ACC Championship in Tampa Florida. The team has played in 35 bowl games, posting a record of 22‚Äì13. The resulting win percentage of 0.629 is currently the second-highest among teams with over 20 bowl appearances. The most recent head coach is former Dallas Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey. In five seasons, Chan Gailey posted a 37‚Äì27 record, 5 straight bowl berths, and a 2‚Äì3 record in bowl games. Chan's 5 straight bowl appearances have the Jackets at 10 in a row overall, an active streak tied for 5th longest in the nation. Chan Gailey was fired on Monday, November 26, 2007. A nationwide search for a new head coach then began, which was ended when highly regarded Navy coach Paul Johnson was hired on December 9, 2007. Three Jacket players were named to the ACC 50th Anniversary Team in 2002: Marco Coleman, OLB; Joe Hamilton, QB; and Ken Swilling, DB. Some notable and more recent Georgia Tech football players are three-time All-American Calvin Johnson, Keith Brooking, Joe Burns, Marco Coleman, Joe Hamilton, Tony Hollings, Dorsey Levens, and Arizona Cardinals head coach Ken Whisenhunt.

Bobby Cremins led his team to the first ACC tournament victory in school history in 1985, and in 1990 he took Georgia Tech to the school's first Final Four appearance ever. Cremins retired from Georgia Tech in 2000 with the school's best coaching win percentage. The current head coach of Georgia Tech is Josh Pastner, who took over from Brian Gregory in 2016. Up until March 2011, Paul Hewitt was the head coach Georgia Tech. Helping revitalize a stagnant program in 2004, he led Georgia Tech to a Cinderella season as the school earned its second berth in an NCAA national title game in any sport. That team won the Pre-Season NIT, ended Duke's 41 game home winning streak, and finished its season losing by 9 points in the national title game to Connecticut. Hewitt was fired on March 12, 2011 after having three losing seasons over the previous four years.\\"Hewitt Relieved Of Coaching Duties\\" RamblinWreck.com (Georgia Tech Athletic Association).

The men's team has won six conference titles since 1918 (one in the SIAA, two in the SoConn, and three in the SEC). They have made 15 NCAA Tournament appearances. The men's tennis team is currently coached by former Georgia Tech player Kenny Thorne, and assisted by Jeremy Efferding. In 2011, Thorne was named ITA National Coach of the Year. Some notable recent Georgia Tech Tennis players are Christopher Eubanks, Irina Falconi, Kevin King, and Juan Carlos Spir. === Volleyball === Georgia Tech Women's Volleyball is one of the newer additions to Georgia Tech's athletic department, having only been started in the past twenty years. Despite the program's youth, it has been a dominant force in the ACC. O'Keefe Gymnasium has served as the home of the Georgia Tech volleyball team since 1995. Georgia Tech volleyball has become a powerful, perennial ACC title contender and NCAA tournament qualifier. Tech has been in the NCAA tournament three times in recent years and has set several school records for victories in a season, consecutive ACC victories, and consecutive victories. ==Other sports== Georgia Tech also fields men and women's track & field, men and women's swimming & diving, men and women's cross country, and assorted club sports. Georgia Tech's Angelo Taylor won gold medals in 400 m hurdles at the 2000 and 2008 Summer Olympics. The non-NCAA sanctioned club sports include but are not limited to crew, cricket, cycling, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, gymnastics, ice hockey, kayaking, lacrosse, paintball, roller hockey, rowing, rugby, sailing, skydiving, soccer, swimming, triathlon, ultimate, water polo, and wrestling. ==TraditionsMascots=== Buzz, the mascot Costumed in plush to look like a yellow jacket, the official mascot of Georgia Tech is Buzz. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for crowd surfing and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans. The Ramblin' Wreck was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \\"To Hell With Georgia\\" and \\"Give 'Em Hell Tech\\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the Ramblin' Reck Club, a selective student leadership organization on campus. ===Spirit organizations=== Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown. The Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features body painting, organized chants, and general fanaticism. The marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events. ===Fight songs and chants=== The band plays the fight songs Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and Up With the White and Gold after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \\"Go Jackets\\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \\"bust their ass\\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \\"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\\" The official cheer only includes \\"Fight, Win\\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version. It is also tradition for the band to play the \\"When You Say Budweiser\\" after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the \\"Budweiser Song\\", all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are Michael Jackson's Thriller for half-time at the Thrillerdome, Ludacris' Move Bitch for large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, \\"What's the Good Word?\\" The response from all Tech faithful is, \\"To Hell With Georgia.\\" The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, \\"How 'bout them dogs?\\" And everyone yells, \\"Piss on 'em.\\" ==ChampionshipsNCAA team championships=== Georgia Tech has won 1 NCAA team national championship. *Women's (1) **Tennis (1): 2007 *see also: **ACC NCAA team championships **List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships ===Other team championships=== Below are 4 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: *Men's: **Football: 1917, 1928, 1952, 1990 ==Notable alumni== Despite their highly technical backgrounds, Tech graduates are no strangers to athletics; approximately 150 Tech students have gone into the NFL, with many others going into the NBA or MLB.

An assessment of a mental state includes a description of thought processes, memory, mood, cognitive state, and energy level. When a mental state is shared by a large proportion of the members of a group or society, it can be called a collective mental state. Gustave Le Bon proposed that mental states are passed by contagion, while Sigmund Freud wrote of war fever in his work Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1922), a perfect example of the collective mental state. Franz Borkenau wrote of collective madness, while many writers have discussed collective depression. Psychosis can be passed from one individual to another as induced psychosis or folie √† deux, but rarely involves more than two people. When the mental state involves a large population, it is more appropriate to use plain English rather than psychiatric or psychological terminology. == Instances of collective mental state == Collective mental states can occur whenever there are a large group of people. They can represent any and all emotions, and the intensity of the emotions can be increased due to the number of people. A positive example of a collective mental state would be at a rave or music festival. People come together through music and may feel content or relaxed, even though they may be surrounded by strangers in a loud, stimulating environment. On the other hand, in a dangerous situation, people can experience high levels of fear and anxiety if they are in a group of people that is panicking. An example of this is when a large group try to get out of a building and the individuals at the front are crushed against the doors by the weight of the people behind them. A type of angry collective state is often referred to as mob mentality. The members of the group feed off of each other's anger and the collective mental state can become very aggressive, as part of the experience is a reduced sense of responsibility for each individual. == See also == * Collective depression * Mass hysteria *Stampede ==References== * Borkenau, Franz, 1981.

From statehood in 1889 until 1909, Washington elected all of its U.S. representatives statewide. In 1909, Washington was divided into congressional districts for purposes of electing representatives. Following the 1950 Census, Washington was granted a seventh seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but the state legislature was unable to agree on a plan to create a geographic district for the seat until 1957, so the seat was filled by a representative elected statewide.Holden, Ashley E. \\"Seventh District Ahead.\\" The Spokesman-Review, Nov. 17, 1956, p. 4. From statehood in 1889 to 1893, Washington elected one representative at-large statewide. From 1893 to 1903, Washington elected two representatives at-large statewide, then added a third seat in 1903. The third seat at large continued until 1909, when all representatives were elected from districts. From 1913 to 1915, Washington elected two representatives at-large statewide, with the remaining three representatives elected from districts. From 1953 to 1959, Washington elected one representative at-large statewide, with the remaining six representatives elected from districts.

It runs in a general east‚Äìwest direction from the junction of LA 75 and LA 942 in Darrow to U.S. Highway 190 (US 190) in Mandeville. The route traverses a variety of terrain and surroundings over the course of its journey, which begins at the Mississippi River in rural Ascension Parish. It also crosses several navigable waterways with movable bridges spanning two of them: the Amite River and Tchefuncte River. After crossing both Interstate 10 (I-10) and US 61 in Sorrento, LA 22 winds through a cypress swamp in Livingston Parish west of Lake Maurepas. Near the town of Springfield, the highway enters the thick pine forest characterizing the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and intersects the concurrent I-55/US 51 in Ponchatoula. On its east end, LA 22 becomes a heavily traveled residential and commercial corridor in suburban St. Tammany Parish between Madisonville and Mandeville. This stretch runs south of the parallel I-12 corridor and feeds traffic onto US 190 and the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway to the New Orleans area. LA 22 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, replacing portions of five shorter former routes. These included State Route 761, State Route 54, State Route 160, State Route 122, and State Route 465. In its early years, LA 22 extended across the Mississippi River by ferry to Donaldsonville prior to the existence of the nearby Sunshine Bridge. The route was also much shorter on its eastern end, terminating at a junction with US 51 and US 190 in Ponchatoula until the latter was re-routed through Covington. ==Route descriptionDarrow to Sorrento=== From the west, LA 22 begins at a junction with LA 75 and LA 942 at the east bank levee of the Mississippi River opposite the city of Donaldsonville. The route heads northeast from the small Ascension Parish community of Darrow as an undivided two-lane highway, traveling through Hillaryville across the Canadian National Railway (CN) line and to the rear of Houmas House Plantation and Gardens. In Burnside, LA 22 intersects LA 44 and passes through a growing suburban area amidst the rural surroundings. Entering the town of Sorrento, the highway intersects LA 70, which leads across the Sunshine Bridge to Donaldsonville. Shortly afterward, LA 22 widens to a divided four-lane highway and passes through a diamond interchange with I-10 at exit 182, connecting with Baton Rouge and New Orleans. LA 22 continues along John Leblanc Boulevard, which largely bypasses the populated portion of the town. The highway crosses the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line, followed closely by US 61 (Airline Highway), which parallels the interstate between the aforementioned cities. ===Sorrento to Lake Maurepas swamp=== Narrowing back to two-lane capacity, LA 22 proceeds north from Sorrento to a T-intersection with LA 429 just east of St. Amant. It then turns due east briefly through an area known as Acy. Resuming its northeastern trajectory, LA 22 begins to wind its way through the swampland that surrounds Lake Maurepas. The highway crosses a bridge over the wide Amite River Diversion Canal, which is lined by boat houses and fishing camps. Continuing into Livingston Parish, LA 22 turns eastward at a T-intersection marking the terminus of LA 16 south of French Settlement. LA 16 leads to Denham Springs and Walker, the most populated areas of the parish, located along I-12. LA 22 follows a serpentine path through several small communities along the Amite River, such as Head of Island, Whitehall, and Maurepas. Curving again to the northeast, LA 22 crosses the river via swing bridge and passes through Killian, located at a junction with LA 444\\\\. The route then proceeds across a higher and longer bridge spanning the Tickfaw River, allowing a splendid view of the surrounding cypress swamp. ===Springfield and Ponchatoula=== Entering the small town of Springfield, LA 22 turns northwest briefly at a T-intersection with LA 1037 (Collum Road). The two routes proceed along the town's main street in a wrong-way concurrency until reaching Walnut Street. From this four-way intersection, LA 1037 turns west toward Tickfaw State Park, LA 42 begins and proceeds along the main street, while LA 22 turns east across the Natalbany River into Tangipahoa Parish. Immediately across the parish line, LA 22 intersects LA 1249, which heads north through Pumpkin Center to a junction with I-12. For the remainder of its journey, LA 22 travels about to the south of I-12, the main east‚Äìwest highway through the Florida Parishes on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. With the terrain having transitioned from swampland to pine forest, the surroundings become more consistently populated as LA 22 heads into the small city of Ponchatoula. On the outskirts of town, LA 22 widens to four lanes as it passes through a full cloverleaf interchange with the concurrent I-55/US 51, connecting with the larger nearby city of Hammond, as well as New Orleans. Just east of the interchange, LA 22 begins a concurrency with US 51 Bus. opposite Ponchatoula Cemetery and gains a center turning lane for a short distance. After traveling several blocks on Pine Street through the historic commercial section of town, US 51 Bus. turns off to the south along the CNRR tracks. East of Ponchatoula, LA 22 resumes as a two-lane highway through the thick pine woods for before crossing into St. Tammany Parish at Bedico. During this stretch, the highway crosses the Tangipahoa River and intersects LA 445, another connection to I-12. ===St. Tammany Parish=== alt=Madisonville waterfront Curving slightly to the southeast, LA 22 heads into the small town of Madisonville, where it becomes known as Mulberry Street. The route crosses LA 21 and LA 1077 at a four-way intersection with Main Street, which leads north toward Covington and south alongside the Tchefuncte River to the shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Maritime Museum. LA 22 crosses the river by way of a second swing bridge, providing views of several upscale houses on the water. Groves of ancient live oak trees line the roadway as it passes briefly through Fairview-Riverside State Park. LA 22 then becomes lined with residential subdivisions and commercial shopping strips as it enters the city of Mandeville. For this stretch, the roadway widens to accommodate an extra travel lane for westbound traffic only, as well as a center turning lane. A divided four-lane thoroughfare known as West Causeway Approach branches off of LA 22 and provides access to several area schools and more residential subdivisions. It also acts as a long ramp to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, a toll bridge to the New Orleans area. LA 22 proceeds about further to its eastern terminus at a diamond interchange with US 190 and North Causeway Boulevard. From this interchange, US 190 heads north on a four-lane freeway alignment toward Covington and straight ahead (east) as a four-lane boulevard through Mandeville. North Causeway Boulevard continues the freeway southward as the main route to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. ===Route classification and data=== LA 22 has several different classifications over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). More than half of the route is classified as a rural major collector, including two large portions from Acy to Springfield and from Ponchatoula to Madisonville. The remainder generally alternates between an urban collector and an urban minor arterial, with the exception of the western portion of the route between Darrow and Sorrento, which is classified as a rural minor collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 27,200 vehicles through the suburban and commercial corridor between Madisonville and Mandeville. High counts were also reported near the I-10 and I-55 interchanges in Sorrento and Ponchatoula, respectively. The lowest numbers occurred along the lightly populated stretch in Livingston Parish southwest of Killian with 1,700 vehicles daily. The posted speed limit is for most of the route but is reduced as low as through town. The entirety of LA 22 from Sorrento to Ponchatoula is part of the Southern Swamps Byway in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. ==History== In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, LA 22 was part of five shorter routes: State Route 761 from Darrow through Burnside; State Route 54 through Sorrento; State Route 160 to Springfield; State Route 122 to Madisonville; and State Route 465 to Mandeville. These highways were joined together under the single designation of LA 22 when the Louisiana Department of Highways renumbered the state highway system in 1955. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to- market). This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system. As the above description indicates, the route initially had different termini. On its western end, LA 22 once crossed the Mississippi River by ferry between Darrow and Donaldsonville and continued along what is now LA 18 to its junction with LA 1. However, the ferry service was discontinued in 1966 after the Sunshine Bridge was completed just downriver from Donaldsonville. On its eastern end, LA 22 originally terminated in Ponchatoula since the highway extending from there to Mandeville was temporarily part of US 190 at the time of the 1955 renumbering. When US 190 was returned to its regular route through Covington the following year, LA 22 was extended to its current terminus at Chinchuba, an area now within the Mandeville city limits. The actual terminus was a simple Y-intersection at what is now LA 3228 (Asbury Drive) until the present diamond interchange aligned with North Causeway Boulevard was constructed in 1981. Several small realignments to the roadway over the years have resulted from the replacement of bridges across three rivers in Livingston Parish. The first was a new bridge across the Natalbany River at Springfield in 1956. About this same time, two 90-degree turns were eliminated as the route was straightened coming into town from the south. In 1974, the current Amite River span was constructed, and most recently, the Tickfaw River bridge was replaced in 2000. In all three cases, portions of the original bridge approaches survive as dead-end local roads, although the bridges themselves have been removed. The only other significant realignment to LA 22 occurred in 1990 when Sorrento's Main Street was bypassed by a new four-lane alignment (John Leblanc Boulevard) that facilitated traffic between I-10 and US 61\\\\. This included the construction of a twin-span bridge across a small waterway known as Bayou Conway. ==Future== La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, two portions of LA 22 are proposed for deletion as they no longer meet a significant interurban travel function. These consist of the westernmost section of the route between Darrow and LA 70 in Sorrento and the section between LA 16 and Killian. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==NotesReferences *Maps / GIS Data Homepage, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development *Southern Swamps Byway at Louisiana Scenic Byways 0022 Category:Transportation in Ascension Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in Livingston Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Louisiana Highway 22"},{"id":"6252532","text":"Quicksilver is a 1986 American drama film written and directed by Thomas Michael Donnelly and starring Kevin Bacon.

Harv Eker (born June 10, 1954) is an author, businessman and motivational speaker known for his theories on wealth and motivation. He is the author of the book Secrets of the Millionaire Mind published by HarperCollins. ==Early life== Eker was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and lived there through his childhood. As a young adult, Eker moved to the United States and started a series of over a dozen different companies before having success with an early retail fitness store. After reportedly making millions through a chain of fitness stores and subsequently losing his fortune through mismanagement, Eker started analyzing the relationships rich people have with their money and wealth , leading him to develop the theories he advances in his writing and speaking today. ==Theories== Eker‚Äôs writing and speaking often focus on his concept of the \\"Millionaire Mind,\\" a collection of \\"mental attitudes that facilitate wealth.\\" This theory proposes that we each possess a \\"financial blueprint,\\" or an \\"internal script that dictates how we relate to money,\\" and that by changing this blueprint people can change their ability to accumulate wealth. Other theories attributed to Eker include the concept that people unwilling to make major sacrifices in order to succeed \\"play the role\\" of the victim and deny that they have control of their own situations. Another concept is that guilt prevents seeking wealth and that \\"thinking about wealth as a means to help others\\" relieves this guilt and enables wealth accumulation. In his book, Eker lists 17 ways in which the financial blueprints of the rich differ from those of the poor and the middle-class. One theme identified in this list is that the rich discard limiting beliefs while the unsuccessful succumb to them. Eker argues that: Rich people believe, \\"I create my life\\", while poor people believe, \\"Life happens to me\\"; rich people focus on opportunities while poor people focus on obstacles; and rich people admire other rich and successful people whereas poor people resent rich and successful people. ==Businessman== Eker founded the seminar company, Peak Potentials Training. According to a Peak Potentials press release, the company was later acquired by Success Resources, an event production company, in 2011.(November 8, 2011) Success Resources Acquires Peak Potential PR Log Eker has produced seminars since at least 2001. A 2005 The Wall Street Journal article cites Eker as an example of changes in non-fiction publishing. The WSJ article examined his use of his seminars, contacts, and personal following as a \\"platform\\" from which to promote sales of his own book. ==Author== Eker is the author of Secrets of the Millionaire Mind which appeared on the New York Times bestseller list and was #1 on the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs business-book list. He has also written a self-published book titled SpeedWealth. ==Controversy== A 2010 report in the Vancouver Sun claimed that Eker was named in a \\"prospective class-action lawsuit\\" involving two individuals who purchased residential properties from people they met while attending one of his seminars.Baines, D.

The Ripoff Report has been online since December 1998 and is operated by Xcentric Ventures, LLC which is based in Tempe, Arizona. ==Reports and rebuttals== Ripoff Report allows users over the age of 14 to complain anonymously about any firm or person. The site requires creating an account before \\"reports\\" can be submitted but it does not verify the identity of users. Ripoff Report results may show up on Google searches for the people (or firms) mentioned in the report, which can be potentially embarrassing or damaging for them. Reports are not automatically added to the website: they must be approved first. According to the site's Terms of Service, users are required to affirm that their reports are truthful and accurate, but the site says that it neither investigates, confirms nor corroborates the accuracy of submissions. Companies or individuals who have been named in a report may respond with a rebuttal at the bottom of the same webpage, which explains their side of the story, if the rebuttal is approved by Ripoff Report. There is no charge to submit a rebuttal, but they must have a registered account. Alternatively, to \\"repair the reputation\\" because of something that is written in the website, Ripoff Report asks them to pay for investigations of complaints and responses carried out by \\"Ripoff Report's pool of Arbitrators\\", and to edit the webpage. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, this mechanism is an example of \\"how to make money rebuilding reputations: have them destroyed first\\", which is why a federal court stated that victims have \\"probable cause to sue for extortion and racketeering\\". ==Operations== Ripoff Report sells ad space on its website and offers companies the option to pay for complaint investigations, which can cost from to over $100,000. It also offers an arbitration program. The site says that, with the exception of cases that are decided against the complainant in arbitration, all complaints remain public and unedited and authors are not allowed to remove their own reports even in cases where a mistake has been made.This stated policy is disclosed to users in the site's Terms of Service: \\"ROR is a permanent record of disputes, including disputes which have been fully resolved. In order to maintain a complete record, information posted on ROR, subject to the Terms outlined herein, will not be removed. By posting information on ROR, you understand and agree that the material you post will become part of ROR's permanent record and will NOT be removed even at your request.\\" (3 July 2016) In May 2013, Ripoff Report started a new service called \\"Ripoff Report Verified\\" that offers companies with no prior complaints an option to become \\"Verified\\". According to an interview with Search Engine Watch, for $89 per month, \\"Once a verified business gets any negative complaints, they would be alerted via email about the negative reviews and will be able to discuss a resolution with the person that left the negative reviews.\\" ==Legal actions== Ripoff Report's legal page claims that \\"you can't sue Ripoff Report just because we provide a forum for speech\\" and that \\"Ripoff Report has had a long history of winning these types of cases. This is because of a federal law called the Communications Decency Act or CDA, 47 U.S.C. ¬ß 230.\\" On the contrary, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that \\"the Communications Decency Act does not immunize Xcentric for the content it creates and posts\\" and \\"does not immunize misrepresentations made by a publisher about its publishing conduct.\\" By creating an account, a user agrees to exclusive venue in Arizona for any legal dispute arising from his or her posting. In June 2013, a federal court in Maryland found that this agreement did not prevent a user from suing both the author of a report and Ripoff Report in Maryland, because the user agreement applied only to the rebuttal, not to the report. In the Blockowicz v. Williams case, 675 F.Supp.2d 912 (N.D.Ill. 2009), a federal district court in Chicago found that Ripoff Report was not required to comply with an injunction to remove reports because it had not been named a defendant in the original lawsuit.Blockowicz v.

Two Australians sued Google over their failure to remove links to defamatory content on Ripoff Report. In February 2011 Dr Janice Duffy filed defamation proceedings in South Australia. In 2015, Duffy prevailed in her defamation case against Google for serving libelous comments, originating from Ripoff Report, and allowing its auto-complete function to assist users in finding the content. As of October 27, 2015, unresolved issues in the case are \\"...the defences of triviality and time limitation, the application for an extension of time, and causation and quantum of damages.\\"> In February 2013, Jarrod Sierocki filed defamation proceedings in Queensland. Sierocki won $287,788.00 in damages and interest against a former partner and client who were forced to admit that they had defamed SIerocki on Ripoff Report's un-redactable forum. A related case against Google appears to be working its way through the Australian courts as of April 23, 2015. In website pages of Public Citizen, it was noted that Ripoff Report has received some criticism of its \\"Corporate Advocacy, Business Remediation & Customer Satisfaction Program,\\" particularly whether Ripoff Report sufficiently discloses all facts that would influence the public's perception of the program. In July 2013 the Government of India ordered a block on accessing the site. The block was removed the next month. In May 2014 the Australian search engine Yahoo!7 blocked the Ripoff Report after multiple defamation complaints. It was unblocked after about a week. Ripoff Report's publisher, Xcentric Ventures, LLC, unsuccessfully sued consumers and their attorneys for malicious prosecution in federal district court in Phoenix, Arizona in 2011. In August 2015, the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals published their order affirming the district court's order dismissing the case. The ruling notes that Xcentric had sued over the consumers' underlying attempted racketeering extortion claim, which \\"alleged that Xcentric attempted to extort money by encouraging third parties to post negative reviews, manipulating the posts to highlight negative reviews and to further highlight the negative reviews if the businesses posted rebuttals, and then charging high fees to 'turn the negative into a positive.' [‚Ä¶] The claim was tenable because a district court had previously held that similar allegations stated an extortion claim against Xcentric,\\" the 9th Circuit wrote in its order. In 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Utah stated that, although the Ripoff Report homepage shows the tag lines \\"By Consumers, for consumers\\" and \\"Don't let them get away with it. Let the truth be known\\", the site allows competitors, and not just consumers, to post comments. The Ripoff Report home page also says: \\"Complaints Reviews Scams Lawsuits Frauds Reported, File your review. Consumers educating consumers\\", which allows a reasonable inference that the Ripoff Report encourages negative content. Moreover, Ripoff Report's webmaster affirmed that positive posts about a company are not allowed in the website. Therefore, the court concluded that the website's owner is not a neutral publisher, because, through large fees that companies must pay for the website's advocacy programs, it has an interest in, and encourages, negative content. === Defamation Action League === The now-defunct Defamation Action League (aka Internet Defamation League) was started in January 2007 by William Stanley to force the shutdown of Ripoff Report and duplicate badbusinessbureau.com (also run by Ed Magedson). The Defamation Action League claimed to be dedicated to fighting online defamation; however, the League has itself engaged in defamation to further its aims. The Defamation Action League's strategy involved \\"protesting\\" the companies which hosted Ripoff Report and badbusinessbureau.com by setting up \\"protest sites\\" and engaging in annoyance strategies such as placing classified ads with the companies' telephone numbers for products they aren't selling or sending mass emails to other customers. In return Magedson filed a lawsuit under RICO. June 21, 2007 preliminary injunction was granted against DefamationAction.com and ComplaintRemover.com.

The station is owned by CHET-5 Broadcasting and broadcasts with three kilowatts of effective radiated power from a transmitter located in the Town of Kingston. Radio Woodstock is known as a progressive station that was at the forefront of both the modern rock and adult album alternative (triple A) formats. The station broadcasts from the Utopia Studios in Bearsville, about 2 miles west of the Village of Woodstock. ==History== WDST first broadcast on April 29, 1980, from studios in Woodstock and a tower in Lake Katrine. Initially, WDST featured a free-form format which was described as \\"public radio with commercials\\". From its sign-on until being sold in 1993, it used the slogan \\"The Bulldog of the Hudson Valley\\". During this free-form period under Program Director Richard Fusco, though the station's eclectic format won three Billboard Magazine \\"Station of the Year\\" awards, the rock portions of the station's programming became the most- listened-to. WDST evolved its format more towards rock music, though free-form elements would remain until the early 1990s. Early hosts include Jeanne Atwood and nighttime DJ The Mysterious Robo. The progressive rock lean of the original format would evolve into an early modern rock format by the mid-1990s. The rise of alternative rock, a genre WDST had to itself, saw the station improve its overall listenership by the early 1990s. In 1993, WDST was sold to CHET-5 Broadcasting along with WKNY in Kingston. Principal owner Gary Chetkof hired promoted Nic Harcourt to the morning show and the station was programmed with an alt-rock format. WDST soon thereafter purchased a radio station in Arlington, New York (a suburb of Poughkeepsie, New York) and simulcast WDST on FM 96.9 MHz (also known as WDSP). It was a natural extension for the 96.9 MHz signal, which debuted in the late 1980s as WEXP Next FM, offering an eclectic mix of modern rock and progressive rock elements. In April 1997, WDSP and WKNY were sold to the Crystal Radio Group, owners of WPDH and WRRV. Because of the loss of the 96.9 MHz simulcast, much of the station's coverage south of Poughkeepsie was lost. In 1998, WDST moved its transmitter site to a tower on Hallihan Hill in the Town of Kingston, slightly north west of the city. This greatly improved overall coverage in the Hudson Valley. Small areas of coverage to the south were restored via translators in Newburgh (1998) and Poughkeepsie (The Poughkeepsie translator service being discontinued in August 2009). Shortly after the sale, then Program Director (PD) Dave Leonard left to start The Woodstock Broadcasting Network at Utopia Studios and (MD) Nic Harcourt left for KCRW in Los Angeles, California, where he hosted Morning Becomes Eclectic until December 2, 2008. To diversify its business offerings, Chetkof started to produce concerts in and around the Hudson Valley and became one of the largest independent concert promoters in the Hudson Valley. It is estimated that Radio Woodstock's concert division has produced over 500 shows, including one day music festivals such as The Felice County Fair at Opus 40 in Saugerties, the Speed of Sound Festival in Wappingers Falls outside Poughkeepsie (with headliners the Avett Brothers in 2015 and The Lumineers in 2016), and various Craft Beer Festivals known as the Boogaloo. In 2005, to celebrate its 25th anniversary, Gary Chetkof formed a new company to produce a musical festival on behalf of the radio station. The Festival was named Mountain Jam after the Allman Brothers song, and was such a success, that it was brought back the following year as a 2 day music and camping festival. The Festival expanded to 3 days the following year, and is currently the Northeast's biggest music and camping festival. In 2013, Chetkof partnered with Townsquare Media to launch the Taste of Country Music Festival the weekend after Mountain Jam and that festival is now the largest country music camping festival in the Northeast. As part of the deal with Townsquare Media, Townsquare also became partners in Mountain Jam and the festival gradually shifted its programming from Jamband music to Inde/Alt Rock. In 2010, Radio Woodstock celebrated its 30th anniversary. The station released two volumes of a 30th anniversary CD featuring live recordings from the station's rich history of hosting top talent for in-studio performances, local concerts, and its annual Mountain Jam Festival. Additionally, Radio Woodstock's year-long 30th Anniversary Concert Series featured performances in the Woodstock area by Assembly of Dust, Amos Lee, and The Hold Steady to name a few. In 2016, Radio Woodstock created the Radio Woodstock Cares Foundation to help raise money for breast cancer research and care in the Hudson Valley. Its Pink October Fundraisers, started in 1998, had become so successful that a 501(c)(3) entity was officially created. Over $500,000 has been raised over the years via a combination of charity concerts, radio-thons supported by listener donations for song requests, and online auctions. Some of the featured concert headliners over the years include Natalie Merchant, The Indigo Girls, Michael Franti, and Brandi Carlile. Also in 2016, Radio Woodstock became one of the first listener- and advertiser-supported commercial FM radio stations in the country. The station pledged to reduce the number of commercials it would play each hour, refused advertising from certain large multi-national corporations whose products were inconsistent with its Woodstock brand, and canceled its contract with the Nielsen Ratings Company. Radio Woodstock won a \\"most innovative station\\" award from the prestigious Jacobs Media in March 2017. The station continues to add supporters via its website and through 2 on-air supporter drives each year. Radio Woodstock is estimated to have nearly 1,000 supporters who pledge 100.1 dollars per year to help the station stay independent and keep its progressive and eclectic programming. ==Programming== Greg Gattine, former production director of WPDH, is the current program director and morning show host. Middays and the Lunch Lounge are hosted by production director Justin Foy, afternoons by music director \\"MK\\" Burnell, and evenings by Dan Cahill (also production and Saturday afternoons). Weekends feature Ron VanWarmer, host of Acoustic Breakfast, and Lenny Bloch, one of the founders of the channel, Jam On on Sirius XM Radio. Radio Woodstock also syndicates shows such as Radio Unleashed with Dave Leonard, eTown,https://www.etown.org/media/find-a-station/ and the Underground Garage, hosted by E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt.http://undergroundgarage.com/radio-show-2/little-steven-s-underground- garage-radio-affiliates.html Radio Woodstock's programming has evolved into a more mainstream Adult Album Alternative (Triple A) format, with popular rock songs from the last 40 years (i.e. from the late 1960s to the present). ==External links== *Radio Woodstock's website * ==References== Category:Adult album alternative radio stations in the United States Category:Mass media in Ulster County, New York Category:Radio stations established in 1980 DST Category:1980 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"WDST"},{"id":"6252664","text":"South Arm is a rural residential locality in the local government area of Clarence in the Hobart region of Tasmania.

After the designed experiment is performed, linear regression is used, sometimes iteratively, to obtain results. Coded variables are often used when constructing this design. ==Implementation== The design consists of three distinct sets of experimental runs: # A factorial (perhaps fractional) design in the factors studied, each having two levels; # A set of center points, experimental runs whose values of each factor are the medians of the values used in the factorial portion. This point is often replicated in order to improve the precision of the experiment; # A set of axial points, experimental runs identical to the centre points except for one factor, which will take on values both below and above the median of the two factorial levels, and typically both outside their range. All factors are varied in this way. ==Design matrix == The design matrix for a central composite design experiment involving k factors is derived from a matrix, d, containing the following three different parts corresponding to the three types of experimental runs: #The matrix F obtained from the factorial experiment. The factor levels are scaled so that its entries are coded as +1 and ‚àí1\\\\. #The matrix C from the center points, denoted in coded variables as (0,0,0,...,0), where there are k zeros. #A matrix E from the axial points, with 2k rows. Each factor is sequentially placed at ¬±Œ± and all other factors are at zero. The value of Œ± is determined by the designer; while arbitrary, some values may give the design desirable properties. This part would look like: : \\\\mathbf E = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ { - \\\\alpha } & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & { - \\\\alpha } & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & {} & {} & {} & {} & {} & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & { - \\\\alpha } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Then d is the vertical concatenation: : \\\\mathbf d = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf F \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf C \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf E \\\\end{bmatrix}. The design matrix X used in linear regression is the horizontal concatenation of a column of 1s (intercept), d, and all elementwise products of a pair of columns of d: :\\\\mathbf X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf 1 & \\\\mathbf d & \\\\mathbf d(1)\\\\times\\\\mathbf d(2) & \\\\mathbf d(1)\\\\times\\\\mathbf d(3) & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf d(k-1)\\\\times\\\\mathbf d(k) & \\\\mathbf d(1)^2 &\\\\mathbf d(2)^2 &\\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf d(k)^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, where d(i) represents the ith column in d. === Choosing Œ± === There are many different methods to select a useful value of Œ±. Let F be the number of points due to the factorial design and T = 2k + n, the number of additional points, where n is the number of central points in the design. Common values are as follows (Myers, 1971): #Orthogonal design:: \\\\alpha = (Q\\\\times F/4)^{1/4}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where Q = (\\\\sqrt{F + T} -\\\\sqrt{F})^2 ; #Rotatable design: Œ± = F1/4 (the design implemented by MATLAB‚Äôs ccdesign function). === Application of central composite designs for optimization === Statistical approaches such as Response Surface Methodology can be employed to maximize the production of a special substance by optimization of operational factors. In contrast to conventional methods, the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques. For instance, in a study, a central composite design was employed to investigate the effect of critical parameters of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw including temperature, time, and ethanol concentration. The residual solid, lignin recovery, and hydrogen yield were selected as the response variables. ==References== Myers, Raymond H. Response Surface Methodology.

It is the only high school in the Clarkston Community Schools. ==History== Clarkston High School used to be in Clarkston, Michigan. The third Clarkston School was built in 1910 on Main Street (M-15). By the time the fourth Clarkston School was completed in 1930 in Independence Township, the area's population had started to decline. After World War II, Independence Township's population began to boom. In 1952, Clarkston Community Schools was formed and Clarkston and Andersonville Elementary Schools were completed, leaving the 6th-to-12th graders as sole occupants at the newly renamed Clarkston High School. Expansions were made in the mid-1950s. By the end of the decade the building could not be expanded anymore, and in 1960, the fifth Clarkston High School was built across the street (although its official address was 6595 Middle Lake Road). The 1930 building became Clarkston Junior High. The 1960 building remained unchanged until major renovations were made in 1993 when freshmen were allowed to attend the school for the first time since 1969. Unfortunately the renovations were not enough to handle nearly 2,000 students, and in 1998 the current building was opened. The 1960 building is now the current Clarkston Junior High, and in recent years freshmen have moved back to that building. In 2005 the old Sashabaw Middle School was renovated and now holds only grades six and seven. The old Clarkston Middle School was also renovated and made into the new Clarkston Junior High School, which holds grades eight and nine. ==Athletics== CHS offers 26 varsity sports, and competes in the Oakland Activities Association or \\"OAA\\". At the state level, the school is classified as \\"Class A\\" or \\"Division 1\\" of the Michigan High School Athletic Association, competing against those schools with the largest enrollments. The \\"Wolves\\" (or Lady Wolves) name is used by most athletic teams at the secondary education level. The chief rival to Clarkston is the Lake Orion High School Dragons, located in Orion Township, Michigan. Clarkston Wolves won the Division 1 Football State Champions in 2013.

He died while on duty in the South Pacific, 8 October 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in recognition of his outstanding service during World War II. Camp Barrett, home of The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico is named after him. ==Biography== Barrett was born on 16 August 1885, at Henderson, Kentucky. Charles was the fifth of six children to Kate Waller Barrett (1857‚Äì1925) and Reverend Robert South Barrett (1851‚Äì1896). He graduated from high school in Alexandria, Virginia. He was commissioned a U.S. Marine Corps second lieutenant on 11 August 1909. He was assigned duty at the Marine Officers School, Port Royal, South Carolina, the following month. In January 1911, Barrett began a few months duty at the Marine Barracks, Boston, Massachusetts, and was detached on 23 May 1911 to report to the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, to command the Marine Detachment aboard the battleship . On 3 September 1911, he transferred to . Barrett landed with the detachment of USS New Jersey at Vera Cruz, Mexico, on 22 April 1914, and participated in the capture of that city. He was detached from the New Jersey on 13 December 1914 to the Marine Barracks, Norfolk, Virginia. Barrett's World War I duty included detached service with the United States Army in France from 25 September 1918. He participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive of November 1‚Äì3, 1918, and in the spring of 1919 was in command of the 2nd Battalion, 367th Infantry at LeMans, France. Detached from the army in April, he reported to the commanding general of 4th Brigade, Marines, at Nieder Bieber, Germany, and was detailed as adjutant from 11 April. He arrived back in the United States on 3 August 1919. From 1921 to 1922, General Barrett served in Santo Domingo and from 1924 to 1927 was a member of the American Battle Monuments Commission, Washington, D.C. He then returned to France to study at the Ecole de Guerre in Paris, and from 1929 to 1933 served as an instructor at the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia. During the next two years, he was assigned to the Division of Operations and Training, Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, and from 1935 to 1936 served aboard ship as Division Marine Officer of Battleship Division 4, U.S. Battle Force. Upon completion of sea duty with the Battle Force, the Barrett spent two and one-half years in the War Plans Section, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Washington, D.C.; and from August 1939 to June 1940, commanded the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force. He returned to Headquarters, Washington, in July 1940, serving first as director of the Division of Plans and Policies. Later he served as assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Lieutenant General Thomas Holcomb, from November 1941 to March 1942. In March 1942, General Barrett assumed command of the 3rd Marine Brigade, and the following month embarked with the brigade for Samoa, where he welded his command into a fighting unit. He was ordered to the United States in September 1942 to assume command of the 3rd Marine Division, then being organized at Camp Elliott, San Diego, California, and was promoted to major general on assuming this command. Major General Barrett was the 3rd Marine Division's first commander. Early in 1943, he embarked with elements of the 3rd Marine Division for Auckland, New Zealand. By August 1943, he had all the major units of his division stationed on Guadalcanal, training intensively for the Bougainville operation. On 15 September 1943, General Barrett relinquished command of the 3rd Marine Division; and on 27 September 1943, Major General Barrett replaced Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift as the commanding general of the First Marine Amphibious Corps (IMAC) (headquartered on Noum√©a, New Caledonia) when Vandegrift was to return to Washington, D.C. to become the 18th Commandant of the Marine Corps. In this capacity, he continued with the planning for the assault on Bougainville until his death three weeks later. According to official accounts, he was accidentally injured following a cerebral hemorrhage and died on 8 October 1943 at the base hospital. General Barrett was buried in the American cemetery in New Caledonia. Following the war, he was reinterred in Arlington National Cemetery. The General's death has always been somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there is evidence that his death was actually a suicide, committed the day after he was fired as IMAC CG by Admiral Halsey. The general fell out of the second floor window of his residence at Noum√©a, and the inquest ruled the death accidental, related to a possible cerebral hemorrhage. However, the interior window sill was four feet above the floor, and a chair was found placed next to it which Barrett apparently used as a step to jump out the window.Rems, Alan. South Pacific Cauldron: World War II's Great Forgotten Battlegrounds. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2014. . p. 92. The sudden death of General Barrett resulted in Vandegrift's recall to the Pacific to resume command of IMAC. ==Decorations and awards== General Barrett's medals and decorations include: { -     -     - } {  - Navy Distinguished Service Medal Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal Mexican Service Medal World War I Victory Medal w/ Meuse-Argonne clasp - Army of Occupation of Germany Medal American Defense Service Medal w/ Base clasp Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal World War II Victory Medal - } ===Distinguished Service Medal citation=== General Barrett was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his World War II service.

It is believed that the Tecuexe derived from the dispersion of Zacateco groups from La Quemada. Like the Zacatecos, the Tecuexe were a tribe belonging to the generic \\"Chichimeca\\" peoples. It is known that they settled next to rivers which they used to their advantage to grow beans and corn. They were also expert artisans, carpenters and musicians. Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote \\"in any place‚Ä¶ all know to work a stone, to make a house simple, to twist a cord and a rope, and the other subtle offices that do not require instruments or much art.\\" The Tecuexe were known for their fierceness and cruelty towards their enemy. They were known to be so brave, it is said, that once, when the Mexica (Aztecs) came from Chicomostoc, Zacatecas to take control of Xolotl, (and course on to the lagoon where they found an eagle devouring a serpent) they attacked the settlers of Acatic, Teocaltiche, Mitic, Teocaltit√°n and Xalostotitl√°n, but in Tepatitl√°n, when they encountered the Tecuexe, having heard of their legendary cruelty, the Mexica avoided facing them. The Tecuexes wore dresses with classic tilmatl (tilma) and huipilli, worn with comfortable cactlis and adorned their bodies with necklaces, bracelets, earrings and nose rings that they themselves made. They liked to make their houses in valleys and gorges near rivers, always in a position ready to battle. They also had temples in Teocaltiche, San Miguel el Alto, Jalostotitl√°n, Teocaltitan de Guadalupe and possibly in Tepatitl√°n. The Tecuexes brought agaves from the wild, and cloned and grew them in open air settings to produce Tequila among other thingsAna Guadalupe Valenzuela Zapata, Gary Paul Nabhan, Tequila: A Natural and Cultural History, Books.google.com, 2003 (called pulque back then and stored in jugs). According to Spanish missionary Juan de Padilla, Tonallan (Tonal√°, Jalisco) was the biggest town under Tecuexe ruling. Tecuexe warriors had horizontal black bands tattoos right below their eyes. The Tecuexes were cannibals and didn't perform any specific ceremony to the Gods when eating human meat. Tonallan was led by a woman, Chihualpilli (meaning queen) Tzpotzinco (meaning distinguished and fine zapote fruit), that Padilla described as tall and very beautiful, and who resided in a palace on the hilltops of Tonallan (Xit√©pec hill). It was during a dinner at her palace that the Mixt√≥n War broke. Padilla attributes the victory of the Spaniards to the divine help of Saint James Matamoros, which explains why the first chapel built by the Tecuexe Catholics was named after SantiagoRichard L. Anderson, Smoking Mirror, Books.google.com, 26 August 2015. ===Spanish Conquest=== They were conquered by Captain Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n who began his siege on December 21 of 1529. His army consisted of 200 Spaniards on horse, 300 infantry on foot, 10,000 Mexicas (Aztecs) and 10,000 Tarascos and Tlaxcaltecas who had switched to the Spanish side. In the fight many died, some took refuge in the mountain areas and those that remained in the plains were enslaved and forced into hard labor. About ten years later they took revenge. They were one of many tribes who fought under Tenamaxtli in the Mixton rebellion (1540‚Äì41). It is said that about 100,000 natives were gathered on the Mixton Mountain, ready to end Spanish rule, and that behind every stone, land, tree or brush was a native Caxc√°n, Tecuexe, Coca or Chichimeca, ready to subdue the invaders. === Mixt√≥n War =The Last of the Tecuexe=== The last Tecuexe chief is said to be Chapalac, who the lake of Chapala is named after. In the end the Spanish power won, but some natives, rather than surrendering and being enslaved, threw their women and their children head first off the cliffs. This was soon stopped by Franciscanos. Fray Antonio de Segovia who took in his hands the venerated image of the Virgin of Zapopan. Acts like these are considered in parallel to Le√≥nidas and his 300 soldiers who died fighting until the last man. After enslavement it is said that by 1854 no one in the tribe could speak their native language, and much of their identity was forgotten. Although today some indigenous tribes remain, they no longer exist as a cultural group. ==Language== The Tecuexe language is now extinct and very little is known about it. It may have been an Uto-Aztecan language.

Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he was a renowned player of the Hammond B-3 organ so earning \\"Hammond\\" as a nickname,[ Allmusic] which also avoided his being confused with jazz guitarist Johnny Smith. ==Biography== Smith played with Paul Williams and Chris Columbo before forming his own group. His bands featured singers Etta Jones, Byrdie Green, saxophonists Houston Person, Earl Edwards, guitarists Eddie McFadden, Floyd Smith, James Clark, vibist Freddie McCoy. His career took off as he was serving as accompanist to singer Nancy Wilson. One of his last accomplishments also included Nancy Wilson. He wrote the song \\"Quiet Fire\\" for her Nancy Now! release in 1988. After a 10-year spell on Prestige Records throughout the 1960s resulting in a series of albums, he signed for soul/R&B; influenced Kudu imprint of Creed Taylor's well-regarded CTI Records jazz record label in 1971. His first album for Taylor, Break Out was chosen that year to launch Kudu. The album featured Grover Washington Jr. as a sideman prior to the launch of his career as a solo recording artist. Three further albums followed with Taylor on Kudu, as he decided to refer to himself as \\"Johnny Hammond\\", after deciding to drop \\"Smith\\" from his name. His style had become increasingly funky as he adapted to the style changes in music, culminating in two popular albums with the Mizell Brothers, Gambler's Life (1974) for the CTI offshoot, Salvation and then in 1975, Gears after switching to another jazz label, Milestone Records. He began using electric and acoustic pianos, starting with Gambler's Life, in addition to his signature instrument. Hammond's song \\"Shifting Gears\\" was featured on the breakbeat compilation Ultimate Breaks and Beats, and was also featured in the soundtrack of the 2006 video game Driver: Parallel Lines as well. Smith also taught at the Cal Poly Pomona music department for several years, beginning in January 1987.

On these systems, the screen savers themselves still came from the XScreenSaver collection, GNOME Screensaver just provided the interface. The GNOME Screensaver interface was designed for improved integration with the GNOME desktop, including themeability, language support, and human interface guidelines compliance. However, it no longer runs any screensavers and is more properly referred to as a screen blanker. Compared to the front end included with XScreenSaver, GNOME Screensaver has a simplified interface but less customizability. For instance, users may not select which screensavers to select at random - either only one is selected or the program randomly selects from the whole list. In addition, the inability to configure individual screensavers and the developers' response to this issue has been criticized by some users. It also lacks a setting to control cycling through different screensavers. In GNOME 3, GNOME Screensaver was drastically simplified, supporting only screen blanking and no graphical screen savers. ==References * Wiki.gnome.org * Git.gnome.org * Frequently Asked Questions * XScreenSaver: On Toolkit Dialogs Category:GNOME Applications Category:Screensavers ","title":"GNOME Screensaver"},{"id":"6252769","text":"Academia Bautista de Puerto Nuevo or ABPN is a private Baptist Academy located in Puerto Nuevo, a part of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

She was the daughter of Sir Muhammad Shafi. Her husband was Mian Shah Nawaz. She studied at Queen Mary College, Lahore, British India. ==Political career== In 1918, she successfully moved the All India Muslim Women's Conference to pass a resolution against polygamy. In 1935, she founded the Punjab Provincial Women's Muslim League. In the Round Table Conference of 1930, she and Radhabai Subbarayan were the only two active members of women's organisations nominated to the conference; they argued unsuccessfully for a 5 per cent reservation for women in the legislatures. In 1937, she was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly and was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Medical Relief and Public Health. In 1938 she became a member of the Women's Central Subcommittee of the All India Muslim League. In 1942 India's government appointed her as a member of the National Defense Council, but the Muslim League asked League members to resign from the Defense Council. She refused and was thus removed from the Muslim League. However, she rejoined the League in 1946, and in that same year was elected to the Central Constituent Assembly. That year she also went along with M. A. Ispahani on a goodwill mission to America, to explain the point of view of the Muslim League. She was arrested along with other Muslim League leaders during the Civil disobedience movement in Punjab in 1947. In 1948, she led a protest of thousands of women in the streets of Lahore, protesting against the fact that a bill encouraging better economic opportunities for women had been removed from the agenda. Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan intervened, and the Muslim Personal Law of Shariat of 1948 was passed; it legally recognized a woman's right to inherit property, including agricultural land, which had not been recognized during British rule of Pakistan. She was president of the provincial branch of the All India Muslim Women's Conference for seven years, and also served as vice-president of the Central Committee of the All India Muslim Women's Conference. She was the first woman in Asia to preside over a legislative session. She was also associated with the education and orphanage committees of the Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam, in Lahore, and with several hospitals, as well as maternity and child welfare committees.

The plaza was named to recognize the 20th-century cultural identity in Philadelphia of the surrounding Italian-American enclave neighborhood and became the designation location of the annual Columbus Day Parade. Marconi Plaza has two main halves, East and West, which are divided in the middle by Broad Street. It is located at the most southern end of the city and within the northern border of the Sports Complex Special Services District. The park plaza is accessible via the Oregon Avenue station of the Broad Street subway. left Boundaries of the Marconi Plaza neighborhood: {  - ! Western half ! Eastern half -  Broad Street to 20th St. from Oregon Avenue to Packer Avenue including Moyamensing Blvd  Broad Street to 8th St. from Oregon Avenue to Packer Avenue - } The urban park plaza itself, from which the neighborhood derives its name (Marconi East and \\"Marco\\" Marconi West), is a rectangular park. The Roman-styled plaza is divided in the center by Broad Street and is bordered by 13th Street, 15th Street, Bigler Street, and Oregon Avenue. ==History== Grand pre-entrance for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition -demolished 1927 1937 Dedication Plaque The plaza design is credited to the strong influence of renowned architect Paul Philippe Cret in 1904 as part of his participation in the Art Jury reviewing the preliminary plans presented by landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers, who were then charged with a modified design to complete the work. .Annual Report - City Parks Association of Philadelphia, Issues 16-26 (pp. 67-70) The Plaza later served as the grand pre-entrance for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition, leading visitors south along a tree lined Southern Boulevard Parkway (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) ( landscaped segment of South Broad Street) to the exhibition grounds that started at Packer Avenue and continued to League Island Park. This neighborhood twin park is mirrored on both sides of Broad Street and became property of the Fairmount Park system. It held the common name of Oregon Plaza until October 18, 1937 when it was officially named Marconi Plaza in honor of the Nobel Prize Laureate Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of Radio. The F. Amadee Bregy School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. ==Architecture== The original design of the Plaza was a two level terrace with pathways, marble trims, urns, influenced by landscaped architecture modeling after Roman gardens and English gardens. The east and west plaza reflected the same winding pathways leading to a raised stepped terrace surrounded by stone railings and entrance sculptures of large urns with two small \\"reflecting\\" pools of water facing Broad Street at the center point, which at that time was cut away from the curbline forming half circles open to traffic on both the east and west. This accent was used in 1926 to position a large Liberty Bell at the center of the street permitting traffic to circle around. Over the years many of the fine details have been erased including the half circled indented curbline on either side of Broad Street at the center. This location also had on both sides of the plaza, two reflecting pools of water. The pools were filled in to provide the foundation for the two statues that were later erected to support the cultural history of the immigrant Italian community and respond to Anti- Italianism. The park is currently lushly covered with 25% trees adorned with park benches, open areas for two tot lots, a baseball field, basketball court, and country cottage style enclosed bocce court. The sidewalk border surrounding the park is densely lined with large maple trees with heights of 30‚Äì50 feet high. ==Public art== Bronze statue of Guglielmo Marconi, sculpted by Saleppichi Giancarlo, erected on the east plaza in 1975 Marble Statue of Christopher Columbus sculpted by Emanuele Caroni, erected October 12, 1876. Relocated 1982 to the west Plaza Bronze statue of Guglielmo Marconi, sculpted by Saleppichi Giancarlo, was erected on the east plaza in 1975 though the efforts of the Italo-American Community organized as the \\"Marconi Memorial Association\\" headed by Dr. Frank P. DiDio. The statue was dedicated on April 25, 1980, to commemorate the 106th anniversary of the birthday of the world- famous Italian scientist and inventor. Marble statue of Christopher Columbus was erected on the west plaza in 1976The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 9, 1976, p 10-D. This work was originally located along Belmont Avenue in Fairmount Park, having been unveiled on October 12, 1876, for Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition. Thought to be the work of Emanuele Caroni, this is said to be first publicly funded monument to Christopher Columbus in the United States. It was purchased for $18,000 with money raised by Italian-Americans and the Columbus Monument Association, through the efforts of Alonzo Viti of Philadelphia and his brothers. The statue's initial installation began an annual tradition for the colony of mostly Italian Americans in South Philadelphia to march each year on Columbus Day to the statue in Fairmount Park. The journey was found to be too exhausting and in 1920 the celebration changed locations. Controversy surrounding Christopher Columbus statue *2018 The words \\"Italian-Americans against racism\\" were painted on the pavement in front of the statue as part of a series of vandalism events on Columbus Day. *2020 During the aftermath of the George Floyd protests and greater Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in June, statues depicting Christopher Columbus as well as other historical figures had become a target for vandalism and city sanctioned removal nationwide. Some members of the Italian-American community of South Philadelphia assembled in Marconi Plaza, believing that the Italian immigrant-created Columbus statue would be destroyed; some of them were armed with baseball bats and surrounded the statue. However, in the wake of the George Floyd protests, outsider far-right counterprotesters who were not from the neighborhood began to show up. Jim Kenney released a statement on twitter; city officials have since declared that the statue will remain on site for the time being and on June 17 city workers boarded it up with a wooden box to protect it.https://www.inquirer.com/news/floyd-protest-columbus-statue- protesters-unrest-philadelphia-police-20200614.html. On June 15 conservative WPHT radio talk show host Dom Giordano interviewed a South Philadelphia resident who defended the statue in a segment called \\"The 'Gravy Seals' Speak Out\\".https://1210wpht.radio.com/media/audio-channel/the-gravy-seals-speak-out When questioned as to why the man would defend the statue, he is quoted as saying \\"...it's more than just a statue , that statue was donated from the community and was paid for by the community. So it represents Italian heritage, even though the history may be blemished on Columbus himself. It's still recognized as an Italian heritage symbol, so we feel like we're being attacked.

The latter group was heard chanting \\"U.S.A\\" before a brawl ensued and a man from each side was detained.https://www.inquirer.com/news/south-philly-protest-marconi-plaza- christopher-columbus-20200623.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR6yX2awLcA.

On August 12, the Philadelphia Art Commission issued an order to remove the statue from Marconi Plaza and to place it in temporary storage. This followed an endorsement of a city proposal, two weeks prior, by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, to remove the statue, citing public safety and susceptibility of damage to the statue as a result of the George Floyd protests.The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"South Philly Columbus statue to be moved from Marconi Plaza, placed in temporary storage\\", August 12, 2020 ==Marconi East: Residential== Mollbore Terraces of Marconi: The 1930s Mollbore Terrace was a unique urban change from the densely lined row houses that characterized most of South Philadelphia. The design included front porches and a rear yard with an access service roadway for trash pick-up. Three separate Mollbore Terrace sections were constructed east of the plaza within the boundaries of 13th Street to 7th Street, and from Oregon Ave to Johnston Street. The layout departed from the standard street grid, offsetting the numbered streets that permitted placing a \\"mini-public-square\\" of green space for houses to face inward on all four sides and directions. The center large rectangular common parks space was originally designated as a \\"Terrace\\" that included pathways, grass and trees with an octagon-shaped wading pool at the west end and a raised octagon sand pit platform with a flag pole at the east end. ==Marconi West: Residential== Roman Terraces of Marconi: The Greco- Roman‚Äìaccented homes west of the plaza from 15th to 19th street, using the same concept but on a smaller scale, include two oval-shaped terrace streets at Smedley and Colorado. The terrace at Colorado Street became well known citywide for its annual decorations and street lighting during the Christmas holidays from 1950 to 2000. Moyamensing Avenue Parkway of Marconi: This main angular dual street with an approximately 50-foot center median landscaped area and tree-lined street, crosses the standard street grid and was designed as an alternative roadway access to the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition. It begins at Oregon Avenue, that once was a headhouse entrance for the 1926 Expo, through to the intersection of 20th Street, Penrose Avenue and Packer Avenue. An architectural design for a grand public square like the squares of Center City Philadelphia (inspired by the Benjamin Franklin Parkway) was planned at the parkway's end point of Penrose Avenue, which was viewed by city planners to be the significant southern gateway to the City. The 1926 square was never developed. ==Boundaries== In 2002 the City of Philadelphia legislated boundaries of the Sports Complex Special Service District. The residential communities defined included Marconi Plaza. The Special District established an overlay providing the basis for a new definition to Marconi East as community \\"three\\" and Marconi West as community \\"four\\". thumb ==See also== *List of parks in Philadelphia ==References== *Philadelphia City Planning Commission - Neighborhood Boundaries *University of Pennsylvania Library, South Philadelphia Neighborhoods - See Map: Neighborhoods south of Passyunk Avenue and Mifflin Street ==External links== * Sports Complex Special District * Friends of Marconi Plaza * Sports Complex Community Boundaries * Statues of Marconi and Columbus * Philly History 1906-1926 Plaza and landscaping South of Oregon Avenue concept design by Olmsted Brothers Category:Neighborhoods in Philadelphia Category:Little Italys in the United States Category:Italian- American culture in Pennsylvania Category:Italian-American culture in Philadelphia Category:Landscape architecture Category:Landscape Category:Cultural landscapes Category:South Philadelphia Category:Municipal parks in Philadelphia Category:Cultural depictions of Christopher Columbus Category:Cultural depictions of Guglielmo Marconi ","title":"Marconi Plaza, Philadelphia"},{"id":"6252798","text":"Pedro Mas√≥ Paulet (born 26 January 1927 in Madrid; died 23 September 2008 in Madrid) was a Spanish director, producer, and scriptwriter.

A-Treat stopped production in 2015, but the brand was purchased by Jaindl Companies and production resumed. ==History== A-Treat was formally established in 1918 by Joseph C. and John L. (\\"Jack\\") Egizio. Their father, Gioacchino Egizio, started a beverage business in the family home in the 600 block of Front Street in Allentown, and later built a small manufacturing facility behind the home. Their mother, Vincenza Munjone, also came from a family involved in the beverage business in Allentown. In 1932, the Egizio brothers moved the business to Union Boulevard in East Allentown, where it remains to this day. Joseph C. Egizio served as the board chairman of A-Treat Bottling Co. until retiring in 1989. He died in 2000, at the age of 96. John L. Egizio, who had started working at the company at the age of 13 delivering sodas on his bicycle, served as vice president and co-owner until his death in 1990. In 1991, the company was the subject of regional news coverage when a smear campaign was launched against A-Treat as it tried to sell its sodas in New York City. The campaign, which targeted African Americans, claimed certain brands of carbonated beverages ‚Äî including those produced by A-Treat ‚Äî were actually manufactured by the Ku Klux Klan and contained stimulants that would \\"sterilize the black man\\". Investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and New York City's Department of Health found the claims to be unsubstantiated and untrue. (See also: Tropical Fantasy) On July 21, 2015, it was announced that the Jaindl Companies had purchased the A-Treat brand, including its name, trademarks, formulas, and related intellectual property. A co-packing agreement was reached with The Coca-Cola Company that keeps production in the Lehigh Valley, with production scheduled to resume in August 2015. A poll was held on July 27th, 2015 to decide the first flavors A-Treat would release onto store shelves. With an unexpected victory, Orange Cream placed first with 17% of the votes, which was later revealed that the poll was manipulated by a single person using multi-login on Google Chrome to cast over 10,000 votes. Black Cherry placed second with 8% of votes, and production of the two flavors was immediately started alongside the eight previously announced flavors: Birch Beer, Cream, Big Blue, Ginger Ale, Sarsaparilla, Orange, Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Diet Cream. A-Treat Grapefruit, another flavor with a devoted following, was the first soda to roll off the line when A-Treat made its return in 2015. On May 20, 2016, A-Treat launched Orange Cream onto store shelves. It was the company's first new flavor in more than six years. ==Products== The company formerly distinguished itself by producing sodas in the traditional manner (e.g., using essential oils and cane sugar, rather than extracts and high fructose corn syrup). As of the final production, the company used both cane sugar syrup and high fructose corn syrup. A-Treat produced soft drinks in at least 16 flavors, including Big Blue (blue raspberry), Birch Beer, Black Cherry, Champagne Kola, Cola, Cream soda, Fruit Punch, two kinds of Ginger Ale (Pale Dry and Golden, formerly Peppery Golden), Grape, Grapefruit, White Birch Beer, Pineapple, Sarsaparilla, two kinds of Orange (regular and Orange Dry), Lime (formerly Tom Collins Mixer), Tonic Water (formerly Quinine Water), Strawberry, Treat-up, and Root Beer. Most, if not all, of these flavors were also produced in a diet formulation. A-Treat Birch Beer and Sarsaparilla are rated highly by connoisseurs of these types of beverages. ==Distribution== A-Treat beverages has limited distribution throughout Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and as far away as Bermuda.

The company was founded in September 1999 with the purchase of WENY-TV (ABC) and WENY-FM & AM radio. In 2002, Kevin Lilly purchased WSEE-TV (CBS) in Erie, Pennsylvania and have since added the CBS and The CW affiliates in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and ABC in the Virgin Islands. Brian and Kevin Lilly are the sons of George Lilly, whose SJL Broadcast Management (also previously known as the Montecito Broadcast Group) was founded in 1984 and based in Montecito, California. SJL owns WICU-TV in Erie and the two Companies purchased three TV stations from Gateway Communications in 2000, and four stations from Emmis Communications in 2005.

In 1994, SJL announced the sale of WJRT-TV and WTVG to ABC due to the possibility of WXYZ-TV changing its affiliation to CBS as part of a large swath of television network affiliation changes occurring at the time; the deal was approved by the FCC in 1995 even though WXYZ-TV was able to renew its affiliation with ABC, which caused three of its sister stations to affiliate with the network.Lilly Broadcasting: Michigan Television.

On July 24, 2007, Montecito announced the sale of all of its remaining stations except WICU (KHON-TV, KOIN, KSNW and KSNT) to New Vision Television, ending the partnership between SJL and The Blackstone Group.New Vision Buys Montecito Stations Broadcasting & Cable July 24, 2007 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted approval of this sale in late-October of that year, and ownership was officially transferred on November 1. On March 1, 2009, the last station formally owned by SJL, WICU, transferred its copyrights to Lilly Broadcasting when it merged its news operations with crosstown sister station WSEE-TV. Though SJL still technically exists (and still ostensibly owns WICU), its visible operations have now been subsumed by Lilly Broadcasting. On November 3, 2010, Broadcasting & Cable magazine announced that SJL Broadcasting made an agreement with Disney to buy back WJRT-TV and WTVG, the two smallest stations in ABC's O&O; portfolio. The sale was completed on April 1, 2011 with both stations general manager exiting their positions at change of ownership.Exclusive: New GMs For Former ABC O&Os; in Flint, Toledo Broadcasting & Cable.

The ceremony is now considered notable, in retrospect, as the year in which Citizen Kane failed to win Best Picture, which instead was awarded to John Ford's How Green Was My Valley. Ford won his third award for Best Director, becoming the second to accomplish three wins in that category, and the first to win in consecutive years (having won for The Grapes of Wrath the previous year). Most public attention was focused on the Best Actress race between sibling rivals Joan Fontaine in Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs Suspicion and Olivia de Havilland for Hold Back the Dawn. Fontaine‚Äôs victory was the only time a performer won for a role in a Hitchcock film. This was also the first year in which documentaries were included. The first Oscar for a documentary was awarded to Churchill's Island. The Little Foxes established a new high of nine nominations without winning a single Oscar. Its mark was matched by Peyton Place in 1957, and exceeded by The Turning Point and The Color Purple, both of which received 11 nominations without a win. Citizen Kane, often later designated as the greatest film ever made in a number of polls, was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but won only one, for Best Original Screenplay. A portion of the ceremony was broadcast by CBS Radio. == Awards == Nominations were announced on February 6, 1942.

It runs in a general east‚Äìwest direction from LA 20 in Schriever to LA 3235 in Larose. The route has two distinct sections, the longer of which travels through Terrebonne Parish on either side of Bayou Terrebonne. It serves as the main highway through the city of Houma, which is also the parish seat. This portion of the highway is bannered east‚Äìwest, though it runs primarily north‚Äìsouth. Southeast of Houma, LA 24 does assume an east‚Äìwest trajectory as it turns away from Bayou Terrebonne and proceeds to the Lafourche Parish community of Larose, located at the junction of Bayou Lafourche and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. LA 24 was designated in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, its two sections previously bearing different designations‚ÄîState Route 69 along Bayou Terrebonne and State Route 966 along the Bourg-Larose Highway. Like many of the region's older rural highways, the former evolved from the natural strip of high ground that formed on the banks of the bayou while the latter was constructed on a man-made embankment by the state highway department in the early 1930s. ==Route descriptionSchriever to Houma=== From the west, LA 24 begins at an interchange with LA 20 in Schriever, a small community located just south of Thibodaux. The interchange is located at a point where LA 20 changes its direction from east to north en route from Gibson to Thibodaux, simultaneously crossing over the BNSF/Union Pacific railroad line. LA 24 initially heads southeast from the base of the overpass as a standard divided four-lane highway. After a short distance, the travel lanes divide onto the one-way pair of West Main Street (eastbound) and West Park Avenue (westbound) to run on either side of Bayou Terrebonne. While traveling from Schriever through the neighboring areas of Magnolia, Gray, and Bayou Cane, LA 24 intersects several other routes that follow parallel bayous. These include LA 311 (Little Bayou Black), LA 316 (Bayou Blue), and LA 660 (Bayou Little Coteau). During this stretch, LA 24 also passes through a diamond interchange with US 90 at exit 202, which connects to Morgan City and New Orleans. In Bayou Cane, LA 24 intersects LA 3040 (Martin Luther King Boulevard), a parallel four-lane highway and commercial corridor through the city of Houma. Entering Houma proper, LA 24 turns eastward, maintaining its path flanking Bayou Terrebonne. The highway passes through the city's historic downtown area and intersects LA 182, the pre-freeway alignment of US 90\\\\. LA 182 runs concurrent with LA 24 for two blocks as it zigzags from Barrow Street onto New Orleans Boulevard. Eastbound LA 182 still provides the most direct connection from Downtown Houma toward New Orleans, as US 90 now bypasses the city. Immediately east of New Orleans Boulevard, LA 24 crosses a high-level twin-span bridge over the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Returning to grade, LA 24 narrow to an undivided two- lane highway, as Main Street begins to carry two-way traffic at an intersection with LA 57 (Grand Caillou Road). At this point, westbound LA 24 traffic crosses from the south side of Bayou Terrebonne to the north side by way of a vertical lift bridge at the LA 57 junction. Park Avenue continues downstream as LA 659, also carrying two-way traffic across the bayou from LA 24. ===East Houma to Larose=== Continuing through East Houma, LA 24 bends to the southeast with Bayou Terrebonne. An intersection with LA 3087 (Prospect Boulevard) provides a connection with LA 182 north of the city. While passing alongside the Houma-Terrebonne Airport, LA 24 begins to follow Bayou Petit Caillou, which branches off of Bayou Terrebonne. In an area known as Presquille, LA 56 picks up this route, while LA 24 makes a zigzag across both Bayous Petit Caillou and Terrebonne, exiting the Houma city limits, to assume the path of LA 659\\\\. Passing through the community of Bourg, LA 24 intersects LA 316 and crosses another lift bridge over the Company Canal. Shortly afterward, LA 24 turns northeast away from Bayou Terrebonne at Klondyke while LA 55 assumes the route southeast toward Montegut. LA 24 then curves eastward again and crosses from Terrebonne Parish into Lafourche Parish. LA 24 follows the Bourg-Larose Highway through thickly wooded swampland for approximately , largely traveling alongside the hidden Bayou Blue. Soon after curving northward along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, LA 24 enters the unincorporated town of Larose. The highway officially ends at a T-intersection with LA 3235, a wide four-lane divided highway. LA 3235 parallels the two-lane LA 1 southward toward Grand Isle, providing a route for trucks and other through traffic in the area. Straight ahead, a local road continues the path of LA 24 to a junction with LA 1 where the latter crosses the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. ===Route classification and data=== LA 24 is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as an urban principal arterial for the majority of its route. During this stretch, the daily traffic volume peaked at 26,000 vehicles in Houma during 2013. The easternmost portion of the route along the Bourg-Larose Highway, however, is classified as a rural minor arterial with traffic volume reported as low as 6,600 vehicles. The posted speed limit ranges from in rural areas to through the center of Houma. The entirety of LA 24 is part of the Wetlands Cultural Byway in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. ==HistoryPre-1955 route designations=== In the original Louisiana Highway system in use prior to 1955, the modern LA 24 was split between two different routes. The longer portion along Bayou Terrebonne from Schriever to Bourg made up the majority of State Route 69, which also extended northwest to Thibodaux (now part of LA 20) and southeast to Montegut (now part of LA 55). Route 69 was one of the first 98 state highway routes designated by the Louisiana Legislature in 1921 as part of an act which also created the Louisiana Highway Commission, an early forerunner of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Like many of the region's older rural highways, this portion of LA 24 evolved from the strip of high ground that formed naturally on the banks of the bayou. By contrast, the remainder of LA 24 between Bourg and Larose follows a man-made embankment through swampland that was constructed in 1933 by the Highway Commission. This portion of the route had been designated as State Route 966 by an act of the state legislature in 1930. ===1955 renumbering=== Routes 69 and 966 were joined together under the single designation of LA 24 when the Louisiana Department of Highways, the successor to the Highway Commission, renumbered the state highway system in 1955. With the 1955 renumbering, the state highway department initially categorized all routes into three classes: \\"A\\" (primary), \\"B\\" (secondary), and \\"C\\" (farm-to-market). This system has since been updated and replaced by a more specific functional classification system. ===Subsequent improvements=== Since 1955, the most significant change to LA 24 has been the widening of much of the highway to four lanes. Previously, the designation existed solely on the west side of Bayou Terrebonne between Schriever and Houma. The opposite roadway, though discontinuous, had been part of the state highway system since 1930 as State Route 965, which became LA 659 in the 1955 renumbering. In the late 1970s, it was incorporated into the route of LA 24 to carry westbound traffic from Houma north to a point near the present US 90 interchange, which was soon to be constructed. By the late 1980s, the east bank roadway had been extended and improved to give LA 24 a continuous four-lane corridor between Schriever and Houma. Many of the other improvements to LA 24 over the years have resulted from the construction and/or replacement of bridges along the route. In 1970, the western terminus at LA 20 in Schriever was converted from a simple T-intersection to a grade- separated interchange. This occurred when a four-lane overpass of the Southern Pacific Railroad (now the BNSF/UP) line was constructed on LA 20, moving the route off of what is now Old Schriever Highway, which crossed the tracks at grade. In 1979, a new bridge running diagonally across Bayou Blue on the Bourg-Larose Highway eliminated a zigzag at that point, straightening the roadway. In Houma, the two high-level bridges crossing the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway were constructed in 1996, replacing two grade-level movable bridges at the same location. Additionally, the junction of LA 24 and US 90, the region's main highway, was moved from what is now LA 182 in Downtown Houma to the present freeway interchange near Gray. The interchange was constructed in 1980, but the freeway existed under the temporary designation of LA 3052 until being completed west to Morgan City in 1999. Most recently, the eastern terminus of LA 24 was slightly truncated in 2015 when the final of the route were transferred to Lafourche Parish. The designation formerly extended past LA 3235 and looped under the West Larose Lift Bridge on LA 1 to intersect that highway at the bridge's eastern approach. This route forced trucks to navigate a tight right-angle turn immediately after a low clearance crossing under the lift bridge. The extension of LA 3235 from Galliano to Larose in the early 2000s eliminated this hazard, and signs now direct all through traffic to turn onto LA 3235 to reach LA 1, although the connection to northbound LA 1 is less direct. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References *Maps / GIS Data Homepage, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development *Wetlands Cultural Byway at Louisiana Scenic Byways 0024 Category:Transportation in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana Category:Transportation in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Louisiana Highway 24"},{"id":"6252859","text":"Bondi could refer to: ==Places in Australia== * Bondi Beach, New South Wales, a beach and suburb of Sydney, Australia * Bondi Junction, New South Wales, a suburb and commercial centre in Sydney, Australia * Bondi, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, Australia * Little Bondi, Northern Territory * North Bondi, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, Australia ==Other== * Bondi (name), surname * BONDI (OMTP), an Open Mobile Terminal Platform initiative, a widget framework for AJAX applications, aimed at mobile devices ==See also== *Bondy, commune in Paris * * ","title":"Bondi"},{"id":"6252868","text":"Bondi or Bondy is a surname.

The Court found that government remuneration of provincial court judges that is lower than what an independent salary commission recommended can be justified. A broader perspective should be taken whether overall conditions of judicial independence have been met and some deference to the government is needed. ==Background== The decision arose from cases from four different provinces, namely Provincial Court Judges‚Äô Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice) from New Brunswick, Ontario Judges‚Äô Assn. v. Ontario (Management Board) from Ontario, Bodner v. Alberta from Alberta, and Conf√©rence des juges du Qu√©bec v. Quebec (Attorney General); Minc v. Quebec (Attorney General) from Quebec. Each case involved interpretation of how to properly pay provincial court judges. The cases arose following the Provincial Judges Reference, which found that in order to ensure salaries are free of political manipulation, independent salary commissions should recommend salaries and governments could deviate from recommendations only for rational reasons. This finding was grounded in principles found in the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867. As the Supreme Court admitted in its 2005 decision, in attempting to ease relations between courts and government, \\"The Reference has not provided the anticipated solution, and more is needed.\\"Para. 3. Specifically, in each of the four cases there were disputes as to what reasons for not following recommendations were rational. Since it was found commissions should have a \\"meaningful effect\\" on remuneration, some courts suggested that the recommendations must be followed.Para. 19. In Alberta, the courts won their case against the government before the Alberta Court of Appeal. The government of Alberta, in not accepting some of the recommendations, noted its economic responsibilities and that compared to other salaries, the recommended judicial salaries were very large.Para. 111. The Court of Appeal, conversely, thought that the requirement that government reasons be rational should be a very difficult test to pass and only \\"extraordinary circumstances\\" could justify not following recommendations.Para. 118. This was based on the fact that the 1997 Reference had mentioned the Anti-Inflation Reference of 1976, which dealt with the definition of economic emergencies. ==Decision== The decision of the Supreme Court was unanimous and written by \\"The Court\\" (i.e., not attributed to a particular judge). In it, the Court quickly dismissed the notion that commission recommendations are mandatory on the grounds that this contradicted the 1997 Reference.Para. 20. The Supreme Court also found that rational justification for not following recommendations could be defined as the government giving full reasons that address the Commissions' points. The government must operate in good faith and its decisions must be constitutional. An irrational rejection would be \\"Bald expressions of rejection or disapproval.\\"Para. 25. The Court added that salaries of judges could be compared with salaries of other government workers as long as the governments explains how they selected who is compared to whom. New evidence can also be cited for not following recommendations, including discoveries that a recommendations' evidence is inaccurate.Para. 26. When government reasons are legally challenged, the Supreme Court instructs reviewing courts to exercise deference to the government.Para.30. Following the 1997 Reference, the Supreme Court found reviewing courts should ask two questions, namely whether reasons are given by the government and whether they are reasonable. In 2005, the Court announced that \\"We are now adding a third stage which requires the reviewing judge to view the matter globally and consider whether the overall purpose of the commission process has been met.\\"Para. 31. This \\"global perspective\\" requires a general evaluation of the situation, questions whether the government has acted rationally despite some small flaws in the government's reasons, and some deference to the government.Para. 38. As for the Anti-Inflation Reference, the Court in 2005 noted that mention of it in the 1997 Reference was merely to demonstrate what constitutes a reviewing method. It was not to say that reasons for not following recommendations should be made only in light of economic emergencies.Para. 34. Applying these new standards to the four cases, the Supreme Court found only the Quebec government's reasons were irrational. The Supreme Court faulted the Quebec government for not addressing the main recommendations.Para.159. ==See also== * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) * Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission * Valente v.

In December 1977 he co-founded an indie rock group, The Go-Betweens, with fellow musician, Grant McLennan. In 1980 Lindy Morrison joined the group on drums and backing vocals and by 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers. In 1988, \\"Streets of Your Town\\", co- written by McLennan and Forster, became the band's biggest chart hit in both Australia and the United Kingdom. The follow-up single, \\"Was There Anything I Could Do?\\", was a No. 16 hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. In December 1989, after recording six albums, The Go-Betweens disbanded. Forster and Morrison had separated as a couple earlier and Forster began his solo music career from 1990. Forster's solo studio albums are Danger in the Past (1990), Calling from a Country Phone (1993), I Had a New York Girlfriend (1995), Warm Nights (1996), The Evangelist (2008) and Songs To Play (2015). Allmusic's Stewart Mason described him, as having \\"a knack for crafty pop songs along with the brooding ballads he contributed to the Go-Betweens' albums, and his solo career has shown a healthy mix of the two styles\\". From 2000 to 2006, The Go-Betweens reformed and issued three more studio albums before Grant McLennan died on 6 May 2006, of a heart attack. In May 2001 \\"Cattle and Cane\\", from The Go-Between's Before Hollywood (1983) was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2008, 16 Lovers Lane (1988) was highlighted on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) TV's The Great Australian Albums series as a classic example of 1980s rock music. Forster began writing as a music critic in 2005 for national current affairs magazine The Monthly and a columnist for its sister publication The Saturday Paper in 2014. For his debut solo album, Danger in the Past, Forster was backed on vocals by Karin B√§umler of German pop group, Baby You Know. In the early 1990s Forster and B√§umler were married, the couple have two children. A portrait of Forster, by the artist known as what, won the 2019 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. ==Biography== Robert Derwent Garth Forster was born on 29 June 1957 and grew up in Brisbane. His father was a fitter and turner and his mother taught physical education. He attended Brisbane Grammar School in Spring Hill where he started to learn guitar and wrote poetry. In 1975 he formed The Mosquitoes with Stephen Hollingsworth and the following year he was in The Godots with Malcolm Kelly. In 1976 Forster met Grant McLennan in drama classes in his second year at the University of Queensland, they were both fans of Bob Dylan and the New York music scene. Forster enjoyed music by Mott the Hoople, Patti Smith, Ry Cooder and The Velvet Underground. In December 1977 the pair co- founded an indie rock group, The Go-Betweens, with Forster on guitar and McLennan on bass guitar, and both as singer-songwriters. Later Forster also provided keyboards and McLennan took up guitar. ===The Go-Betweens=== In May 1978 Forster's first recorded work was the group's debut single, \\"Lee Remick\\", which appeared in September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled \\"I didn't have a girlfriend or any sort of romantic side to my life ... I wanted to write a love song. But who was I in love with? No-one. I had to find someone and I found Lee Remick\\". He also wrote the B-side, \\"Karen\\", as an ode to the university's library staff, \\"[t]here was kindness in the library, then you walk out of the library into the harsh real world\\". Forster then wrote their second single, \\"People Say\\". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were \\"sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim\\". In November 1979 The Go-Betweens relocated to London, they re-released their early material and followed with another single, \\"I Need Two Heads\\", also written by Forster. It peaked at No. 6 on the United Kingdom Independent Charts. The group remained in UK for almost a year but ran out of money and needed a drummer, so they returned to Brisbane. By November 1980 Lindy Morrison (ex-Xero) had joined the group on drums and backing vocals. By 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers, she later remembered \\"Robert never took part in any group discussions ... He would not stay in the house if there were other people present ... he and I would have cups of tea on the verandah and debate the place of politics in art\\". As a member of The Go-Betweens he contributed to all their studio albums, Send Me a Lullaby (February 1982), Before Hollywood (May 1983), Spring Hill Fair (September 1984), Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express (March 1986), Tallulah (June 1987) and 16 Lovers Lane (September 1988). Forster and McLennan wrote most of the tracks for the band's albums and alternated lead vocal duties. By December 1989 the group disbanded; Forster and Morrison had separated as a couple earlier and Forster began his solo music career from 1990. Back in 1982, The Go-Betweens' Forster, McLennan and Morrison had recorded, \\"After the Fireworks\\", as a collaboration with The Birthday Party's Nick Cave on vocals, Mick Harvey on piano and Rowland S. Howard on guitar. It was released that year as a single under the band name, Tuff Monks, on Au Go Go Records. ===The Go-Betweens breakup=== After the disbandment of The Go- Betweens, Forster relocated to Germany in 1990 and recorded his debut solo album, Danger in the Past, in Berlin. It was produced by Harvey (Anita Lane) and issued on Beggars Banquet Records. Allmusic's Ned Raggett found the album showed \\"literate, understated rock & roll\\" with his \\"gently cracked, high vocals\\" and \\"setting and maintaining a variety of moods from sudden energy to soft rumination\\". In November he issued a single, \\"Baby Stones\\", from the album. Also that year he provided guitar for German pop group Baby You Know's debut album, To Live Is to Fly. Karin B√§umler featured on violin and vocals on To Live Is to Fly. B√§umler also provided vocals for Forster's Danger in the Past. Forster and B√§umler married in the early 1990s. By 1993 Forster had returned to Brisbane to record his second solo album, Calling from a Country Phone, at Sunshine Studios with members of local pop group, Custard. It was produced by Forster and issued on Shock Records and Beggars Banquet in June. A single, \\"Drop\\", had appeared a month ahead of the album. For touring he formed Robert Forster's Silver Backwash with David McCormack on guitar, Robert Moore on bass guitar and Glenn Thompson on drums. Although described as a \\"bustling country-pop\\" album by McFarlane, according to Allmusic's Greg Adams its \\"folk- rock sound ... recalls Felt's Me and a Monkey on the Moon more than ... Nashville\\". Forster also produced his third solo album, I Had a New York Girlfriend, which is a collection of cover versions recorded in Melbourne in 1994. Raggett felt it was \\"an interesting and at times defiantly anti-hip visit through a surprising, entertaining selection of songs\\". By 1995 Forster had formed a three-piece group, Warm Nights, with Thompson and Adele Pickvance on bass guitar. Late that year Forster and McLennan performed together in Brisbane and the duo were accompanied by Pickvance and Thompson. Forster denied it was a tribute show: \\"anyone that did the Australian Go-Betweens Show would be tighter ... people that start those [tribute] bands generally play a lot tighter than the bands that they're honouring or copying or whatever\\". In May the following year the same line-up performed at Les Inrockuptibless 10th anniversary celebration in Paris. Forster's next solo album, Warm Nights, was recorded in London in 1996 and produced by Edwyn Collins (The Proclaimers, Vic Godard, A House) ‚Äì Collins also provided guitar alongside a five-member brass section. The rhythm section were Pickvance and Thompson. It appeared in September that year and McFarlane described it as \\"a laid-back collection of summery pop\\". Raggett found it is \\"a touch less obviously country-pitched in comparison ‚Äì more of the deft, understated rock/pop\\". The album's lead single, \\"Cryin' Love\\", included a music video which McFarlane states is \\"one of the most entertaining film clips for the year\\". In mid-1997 Forster and McLennan briefly reformed The Go-Betweens for a series of gigs in the UK. ===The Go- Betweens reformation=== In 2000, after both Forster and McLennan had each recorded four solo albums, The Go-Betweens reformed with Pickvance, to create a new studio album, The Friends of Rachel Worth, they were assisted by Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney, Quasi) on drums and backing vocals and Sam Coomes (Quasi) on keyboards. It was issued in September with B√§umler credited for string arrangements, and production duties shared by Coomes, Forster, McLennan and Weiss. Allmusic's Hal Horowitz praised their \\"[p]oetic, languid, spoken/sung vocals similar to Lou Reed weave between lovely melodies whose appeal unfolds with repeated listens\\"; however it \\"sounds more like a combination of two solo albums rather than one from a cohesive unit\\". The Village Voices critic, Robert Christgau, described them as \\"rather than lyric poets, as I once thought, Forster and McLennan are better conceived as short- story writers, with the concreteness and forward motion of voices and music compensating for imagistic technique and low word count\\". He declared that Forster's tracks \\"are the catchiest and most fetching tracks on the album, taking up surfing dreams, a fond and funny envoi to Patti Smith, and a life- swapping fable that when you think about it may be a love song after all\\". All Tomorrow's Parties, Mt Buller, Victoria, on 10 January 2009. The Go-Betweens line-up of Forster, McLennan, Pickvance and Thompson (he had rejoined in 2001) issued two more studio albums, Bright Yellow Bright Orange (2003) and Oceans Apart (2005), Allmusic's Stewart Mason described Forster as having \\"a knack for crafty pop songs along with the brooding ballads he contributed to the Go- Betweens' albums, and his solo career has shown a healthy mix of the two styles\\". Grant McLennan died on 6 May 2006 of a heart attack, aged 48. ===Solo career=== Robert Forster performing at King George, Cologne (Germany), on 10 November 2017.In July 2007 Forster resumed his solo music career with live performances over four nights at the Queensland Music Festival. He picked three songs co-written with McLennan, including \\"Demon Days\\", which is the last track the pair wrote together, and recorded them alongside his own material for his first solo album in 11 years, The Evangelist, which was released on 26 April 2008 through Yep Roc Records. It had been recorded with Pickvance and Thompson at Good Luck Studios, London, from September to November 2007 (except a track, \\"A Place to Hide Away\\"). Allmusic's Thom Jurek noted that Forster \\"has never been this direct before, so unadorned and honest, and yes, vulnerable without the mask of his gift to weave a story, even in first person, and make himself seem a narrator\\". ==Music journalism== Since May 2005 Forster has had a parallel career as a music critic, he began writing for the Australian magazine, The Monthly and its sister publication The Saturday Paper in 2014. Previously he had virtually no print experience, with only a column on hair care for a fanzine in the 1980s to his credit. He was asked by then-editor of The Monthly, Christian Ryan, to write a regular column. Forster later recalled \\"[m]usic journalism was something that always interested me but only as a reader. I thought about music and I would almost run ideas through my head when I listened to a record or saw a concert, but I never put any of thoughts to paper\\". On 25 October 2006 Forster won the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing for his columns. In 2009 he collated some of his critiques, written from 2005 to 2009, on international artists The Rolling Stones, Nana Mouskouri, Neil Diamond and Cat Power as well as Australian acts Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Mark Seymour and Paul Kelly. It was published as The 10 Rules of Rock and Roll: Collected Music Writings 2005‚Äì09 on Black Inc books. ==Musical legacy== In May 2001 \\"Cattle and Cane\\", co-written by Forster and McLennan, from The Go-Between's Before Hollywood (1983) was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2008, 16 Lovers Lane (1988) was highlighted on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) TV's The Great Australian Albums series as a classic example of 1980s rock music. On 25 June 2010, the Brisbane City Council celebrated the opening of the Go Between Bridge with a concert featuring performances by Forster, Angus & Julia Stone, Josh Pyke and Bob Evans. In May 2013 Forster performed at Primera Persona, Barcelona, he was backed by local indie musicians, Part Company. He described his writing to Time Out Barcelonas Marta Salicr√∫ \\"[m]y work is very autobiographical ‚Äì I'm a singer-songwriter ... My songs reflect on and talk about my life and how I've lived it. But I'm not one of those lyricists who explains everything. My stories aren't obvious. There are some singer-songwriters who say too much\\". His repertoire included new songs, which he hoped to record. ==Bibliography== ;Articles * \\"The Exford Dregs,\\" The Monthly, 11, April 2006 * \\"A True Hipster,\\" The Monthly, 14, July 2006 * \\"Modern Times and Times Before That,\\" The Monthly, 17, October 2006 * \\"The Coronation of Normie Rowe,\\" Meanjin, volume 65, number 3, 2006, pp. 48‚Äì52. * \\"Love Goes to a Building on Fire,\\" The Monthly, 21, March 2007, pp. 58‚Äì60. * Reviews Paul Kelly's Songs from the South and Songs from the South Volume 2. ;Books * * * ==DiscographySolo albums=== *Danger in the Past (1990) *Calling from a Country Phone (1993) *I Had a New York Girlfriend (1995) *Warm Nights (1996) *The Evangelist (2008) *Songs to Play (2015) *Inferno (2019) ===Compilation albums=== *Intermission (2007) ===Other appearances=== *Songs for the Young at Heart (2007) ‚Äì contributed \\"Uncle Sigmund's Clockwork Storybook\\" *I'm Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen (1991) ‚Äì contributed \\"Tower of Song\\" ===With Go- Betweens=== * See The Go-Betweens ==Filmography== *Pr√ºfstand VII as F√§hrmann (2002) *Big Gold Dream (documentary) as narrator (2015) == References  Citations = Sources === ; General * Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality. * Note: [online] version has limited functionality. * ==External links== * * Photographs at National Library of Australia: **\\"Robert Forster and Warm Nights performing in Brisbane, Queensland, ca. 1992\\", by Peter Fischmann; **\\"Robert Forster and Warm Nights in a promotional shot in Turbot Street, Brisbane, Queensland, ca. 1992\\", by Fischmann; **\\"Poster advertising performance by Robert Forster at The Continental Caf√©, Prahran, Victoria\\" √ó4, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1996, by unknown artist(s); **\\"Brisbane band The Go-Betweens performing at the Zoo in Fortitude Valley, Queensland, 1995\\" by Fischmann; **\\"Robert Forster at the Zoo Nightclub in Brisbane, 1995\\" by Fischmann; **\\"Brisbane band The Go-Betweens performing at the Legions Club in Fortitude Valley, Queensland, 1996\\" by Fischmann; **\\"Poster advertising performance by Robert Forster and Grant McLennan at The Continental Caf√©, Prahran, Victoria\\", 1999, by unknown artist.

From at least 1946, she was aligned with Mathias Corvin, known for his generous attitude towards the Soviet Union. In 1950, a dispute developed in which the PCI refused to follow the line of the Fourth International. Prominently among the PCI's Central Committee, Mestre supported the International's line. As a result, in 1951, she was removed as editor of the newspaper and sidelined in the party. In 1952, the leadership of the Fourth International removed the Central Committee and created a new one representing their supporters, based around Mestre and Pierre Frank. The actions of the International prompted a split, the majority of party members leaving to form a new group of the same name, led by Pierre Lambert and Marcel Bleibtreu. The following year, the Fourth International itself split, Mestre's group siding with the International Secretariat of the Fourth International, and Lambert's joining the International Committee of the Fourth International. In 1954, Mestre walked out of the Fourth Congress of the Fourth International, along with Corvin and a small group of supporters. They soon joined the French Communist Party (PCF), where they formed a \\"Revolutionary Tendency\\". Within the PCF, she renounced Trotskyism and helped uncover some Trotskyist entrists. After the Sino-Soviet Split, Mestre and Corvin were the first to distribute Maoist literature in France. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Internationalist Communist Party politicians Category:French Communist Party politicians Category:French women in politics Category:French Trotskyists Category:20th-century French politicians Category:20th-century French women politicians ","title":"Lucienne Abraham"},{"id":"6253019","text":"Mantrapping for Sport and Profit is the fourth album from the New Hampshire group Scissorfight. ==Track listing== # \\"Acid for Blood\\" - 3:22 # \\"New Hampshire's All Right If You Like Fighting - 3:00 # \\"Rats U.S.A.\\" - 2:38 # \\"Deliver The Yankee Coffin\\" - 2:31 # \\"The Most Dangerous Animal Is Me\\" - 3:44 # \\"Hazard to Navigation\\" - 5:55 # \\"Hammerdown\\" - 3:01 # \\"Blizzards, Buzzards, Bastards\\" - 3:55 # \\"Mantrap\\" - 2:35 # \\"Death In The Wilderness\\" - 2:55 # \\"Candy Clark\\" - 2:55 # \\"Go Cave!\\" - 3:15 # \\"Cram It Clown\\" - 1:41 ==Personnel== *Ironlung ‚Äì vocals *Geezum H.

Klemmer (born July 3, 1946) is an American saxophonist, composer, songwriter, and arranger.[ Allmusic biography] He was born in Chicago, Illinois, and began playing guitar at the age of 5 and alto saxophone at the age of 11. His other early interests included graphics and visual art, writing, dance, puppetry, painting, sculpting, and poetry. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and began touring with various local midwest \\"ghost big bands\\" (Les Elgart, Woody Herman) as well as playing with small local jazz and rock groups. After switching to tenor saxophone in high school, Klemmer participated in the Chicago jazz scene, playing with commercial small groups and big bands while leading his own groups and touring. ==Biography== Klemmer had extensive studies in music, taking private lessons as a youth and in college in piano, conducting, harmony, theory, composition, arranging, clarinet, flute and classical and jazz saxophone. He studied saxophone and jazz improvisation with noted Chicago saxophonist and teacher Joe Daley. He attended the prestigious Interlochen's National Music Camp. The year he graduated from high school, Klemmer was signed by producer Esmond Edwards at Cadet/Chess Records, eventually recording five albums with Cadet/Chess, including his innovative hit 1969 album, Blowin Gold (co-produced by ex- Rolling Stones producer Marshall Chess). This album was considered by many as the first of the jazz/rock fusion genre; follow-up albums introduced innovative rock rhythms, sounds and production techniques and debuted electronic effects with the saxophone that became his now trademark delay sound. Klemmer led his own groups touring the U.S. using the cream of the Chicago sideman such as Jodie Christian, Wilbur Campbell and Cleveland Eaton, while occasionally performing in tandem with good friends such as jazz artists Eddie Harris and Oscar Brashear, arranger Les Hooper and rock artists such as James William Guercio (later to produce Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago) and various rock artists such as guitarist Harvey Mandel. Klemmer did his first PBS special for WTTW TV Chicago. He was also a busy sideman, exploring every genre of music. He then moved to Los Angeles the following year and for a very brief time was a key soloist & arranger with Don Ellis's) innovative big band touring Europe and toured Africa with Oliver Nelson for the State Department while also working with such diverse artists of a variety of musical genres such as Tim Buckley and others. He studied film scoring with Albert Harris and vocal lessons with Seth Riggs. Continuing always through the events described, Klemmer continuously lead his own small groups touring across the U.S. further developing his unique sound, style and concepts. He primarily focused on his jazz rock fusion styles returning briefly to more traditional jazz and then switching to a more \\"intense\\" so-called \\"Coltraneish\\" approach upon leaving Chess Records and signing with and recording five albums for Impulse! Records. He performed at the Newport and Monterey Jazz Festivals, Antibes Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, Tanglewood, and Montreux Jazz Festival plus TV shows the Midnight Special and Rock Concert. Klemmer has composed all songs for many of his albums, amassing a large and valuable publishing catalog, but he has also collaborated and co-written musically and as lyricist with many pop songwriters, such as David Batteau, with the UK hit \\"Walk In Love\\", recorded by The Manhattan Transfer, Danny O'Keefe, Clint Holmes, Pamela Oland, and many others. After another of his many controversial sabbaticals, he again changed musical direction by then moving to ABC/MCA Records briefly returning to his early R&B; & pop roots. Klemmer then went on to earn massive crossover appeal with his now landmark series of the classic \\"Touch\\" recordings. Klemmer and the \\"Touch\\" series of recordings are regarded by many as paving the way and being \\"the founder\\" of the current \\"Smooth Jazz\\" genre some anointing him \\"The Ambassador of Cool\\". His continuous fast changing of musical directions throughout his career created some controversy, confusion and false speculative motivational assumptions and judgements from his primarily earlier jazz purist audience, primarily, with the now historic \\"Touch\\" series of recordings. His managerial associations with noted former Doors manager, Bill Siddons and with Faith Hill, Keith Urban, and James Taylor manager, Gary Borman, helped Klemmer expose his music to a growing number of pop, rock, R&B; and adult contemporary audiences. He toured extensively as headliner and with \\"package tours\\" with George Benson, and Herbie Hancock plus numerous TV appearances arranged by the William Morris Agency. He expanded his musical palette to include, kalimba, flutes, keyboards, percussion and solo vocal. At this time he further developed his innovative Solo Sax Concept resulting in the now landmark recording of Cry ushering in, thought by many, the \\"New Age Music Spiritual\\" genre, with some now calling him the \\"Sax God\\". In 1979, he briefly returned to his earlier jazz roots recording the \\"straight ahead jazz\\" 2-CD offering, Nexus For Duo & Trio, now considered by many a classic, at personal request of Clive Davis for former Arista/Bluebird/RCA Records, followed by occasional special recording projects such as duo recordings with Joe Sample and Oscar Castro-Neves. Following another of his sabbaticals he then, upon personal urging of legendary pop and rock music mogul Joe Smith, moved to Elektra Records, recording five albums. After another brief sabbatical he then returned to Verve/GRP for Universal Records where his primary vast catalog of recordings reside. Klemmer then took his longest and most controversial sabbatical, causing numerous false rumors of personal and health problems as he continued writing, recording and working with the massive new digital technologies plus returning to vocal studies with noted Macy Gray and Brandi vocal teacher, Roger Burnley. He then returned to recording as guest soloist with such New Age artists as 3rd Force, David Arkenstone, and Craig Chaquico while also returning to his performing, touring and recording career. Klemmer founded his own record label, Touch Records, for \\"special projects & releases only\\" with the compact disc and digital releases of Making Love - Vol. 1, Rio - Vol. 1, and Rio - Vol. 2 as an adjunct to his major label activity such as the Verve/GRP Records release of The Very Best Of John Klemmer (602498831946) from 2005, including three newly recorded bonus tracks from future releases. Klemmer's music has been sampled by a large number of hip-hop, rap and DJ artists primarily focused on his early Chess record recordings. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed John Klemmer among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==DiscographyAs leader=== * 1967: Involvement - The John Klemmer Quartets (Cadet LPS-797; CD reissue: Verve B0000264 02) * 1968: And We Were Lovers (Cadet LPS-808) * 1969: Blowin' Gold (Cadet Concept LPS-321; CD reissue: Universal [Japan] UCCC-9034) * 1969: All The Children Cried (Cadet Concept LPS-326) * 1970: Eruptions (Cadet Concept LPS-330) * 1971: Constant Throb (Impulse!/ABC AS-9214; MCA 37017) * 1972: Waterfalls (Impulse!/ABC AS-9220; MCA 37018; CD reissue: MCA 33123) * 1973: Intensity (Impulse!/ABC AS-9244; MCA 37019) * 1974: Magic and Movement (Impulse!/ABC AS-9269; MCA 37020) * 1974: Fresh Feathers (ABC AB-836; MCA 37012) * 1975: Touch (ABC AB-922; MCA 37152; MCA 1654; CD reissue: MCA 37152) * 1976: Barefoot Ballet (ABC AB-950; MCA 37013; MCA 1583; CD reissue: Verve B0011206 02) * 1976: Magic Moments (Chess/GRT 2ACMJ-401 [2LP]) - compilation of the three Cadet Concept albums. * 1977: Lifestyle (Living & Loving) (ABC AB-1007; MCA 37014; MCA 1584; CD reissue: MCA 31351) * 1977: Arabesque (ABC AA-1068; MCA 37015; MCA 1585; MCA 5858; CD reissue: Verve B0012177 02) * 1978: Solo Saxophone - Cry (ABC AA-1106; MCA 37016; CD reissue: MCA 31352) * 1978: Simpatico [John Klemmer & Oscar Castro-Neves Duo] (JVC 2069; JVC 9025; Samson 29907; CD reissue: JVC 2069) * 1979: Brazilia (ABC AA-1116; MCA 37115; MCA 1639; CD reissue: MCA 5864) * 1979: Straight From The Heart (MCA-Nautilus NR-4) * 1979: Nexus - For Duo And Trio [John Klemmer/Bob Magnusson/Carl Burnett] (Arista-Novus AN2-3500 [2LP]; CD reissue: RCA Bluebird 6577-2-RB) * 1979: Mosaic: The Best Of John Klemmer, Volume One (MCA 2-8014 [2LP]; MCA 2-6007 [2LP]; CD reissue: GRP GRD-9838) - compilation * 1980: Magnificent Madness (Elektra 6E-284; CD reissue: Wounded Bird WOU-197) * 1981: Hush (Elektra 5E-527; CD reissue: Wounded Bird WOU-527) * 1981: Solo Saxophone II - Life (Elektra 5E-566; CD reissue: Wounded Bird WOU-566) * 1981: Finesse (Elektra-Nautilus NR-22; Elektra Musician E1-60197; CD reissue: Wounded Bird WOU-197) * 1982: Two Tone [John Klemmer/Eddie Harris/Joe Sample/Phil Upchurch] (Crusaders CRP-16015) * 1982: The Saxophone Player: The Best Of John Klemmer, Volume II (The Impulse Years) (MCA 2-6017 [2LP]) - compilation * 1982: Blowin' Gold (Chess/All Platinum/Sugar Hill CH2-8300 [2LP]; Chess/MCA CH2-92501 [2LP]) - reissue of Magic Moments * 1989: Music (MCA MCAD-6246) * 1998: Making Love, Vol. 1 (Touch TRCD-1001) * 1999: John Klemmer - Priceless Jazz Collection #38 (GRP GRD-9946) - compilation ===As sideman=== With Don Ellis *Autumn (Columbia, 1968) *The New Don Ellis Band Goes Underground (Columbia, 1969) *Don Ellis at Fillmore (Columbia, 1970 [2LP]) With others... *Dave Remington's Big Band - Chicago Shouts!

A left-hander, Rooker pitched for the Detroit Tigers (1968), Kansas City Royals (1969‚Äì1973) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1974‚Äì1980). ==Early career== Signed as an amateur free agent by the Detroit Tigers, Rooker spent seven years in the Detroit farm system until he debuted in , pitching 4 innings in two games in relief. After being selected by the Kansas City Royals in the October 1968 expansion draft he made the starting rotation. In he won only four games against 16 losses; however, in one of the losses, on July 7 against the Minnesota Twins, he became the first Royal to hit two home runs in one game. Both home runs were off Jim Kaat. Rooker improved his record to 10‚Äì15 in ; one of the losses came in a 12-inning game against the New York Yankees on June 4 after Horace Clarke broke upRoyals lose in 12 innings; Rooker blows no-hit game Rooker's bid for a no-hitter leading off the ninth with a single then came around to score after a Bobby Murcer double. After winning only seven games against 13 losses over the next two seasons Rooker was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Gene Garber.Rooker to Bucs; Garber to Royals ==Pittsburgh Pirates== Rooker enjoyed his best seasons in Pittsburgh, posting a 10‚Äì6 record in and a 15‚Äì11 record with a 2.78 earned run average in . The wins and ERA were a career best, as was his strikeout total (139). The Pirates won the National League East title the latter year, and Rooker pitched in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He gave up two runs in 7 innings but was not involved in the decision; the Dodgers won the game, then went on to win the Series. In Rooker went 13‚Äì11 with a 2.97 ERA as the Pirates won the NL East title again; once again, however, the Pirates were defeated in the NLCS, this time by the eventual World Champion Cincinnati Reds. In Game Two of that Series Rooker gave up four runs in as many innings, including a two-run home run to Tony P√©rez in the first inning. The Pirates did not win the NL East title in or (the Philadelphia Phillies won it in both seasons), but Rooker maintained his consistency during those two seasons, with a 15‚Äì8 and 14‚Äì9 record respectively. At the end of September in 1977, he broke his arm in a car accident. In he slumped to 9‚Äì11 and his ERA rose to 4.24‚Äîthe highest it had been since 4.38 in . In Rooker was a member of the Willie Stargell-led World Championship team. His career nearing the end, Rooker posted a 4‚Äì7 record as a spot starter. Starting Game Five of that Series with his Pirates trailing the Baltimore Orioles three games to one, Rooker gave up one run in five innings and left the game trailing by that 1‚Äì0 score. Pittsburgh rallied to score seven runs over the next three innings and got four shutout innings from Bert Blyleven to win the game 7‚Äì1, then won the next two games to take the Series. In his career Rooker won 103 games against 109 losses, with 976 strikeouts and a 3.46 ERA in 1810 innings pitched. He loves dogs and is an avid dog trainer. A good hitting pitcher in his career, Rooker compiled a .201 batting average (122-for-606) with 54 runs, 7 home runs and 56 RBI. In 1969 he hit 4 home runs for the Royals and in 1970 had 13 RBI. In 1974, he hit .305 (29-for-85) for the Pirates. Rooker also went into politics after his baseball career. A Republican, he once ran for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and once for the United States Congress, but lost both races. ==\\"If we don't win, I'll walk back to Pittsburgh\\"== After his playing career, Rooker, well known for speaking his mind as a player, joined the Pirates‚Äô radio and television broadcast team, with whom he worked as a color analyst from 1981 (one year after he retired) through 1993. He also worked for ESPN from 1994 to 1997. Rooker's most famous moment as a broadcaster came on June 8, 1989, during a Pirates‚Äô road game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium. The Pirates scored 10 runs in the top of the first inning, including three on a Barry Bonds home run. As the Pirates' cross-state rivals came to bat in the bottom of the first, Rooker said on the air, \\"If we don't win this one, I don't think I'd want to be on that plane ride home. Matter of fact, if we don't win, I'll walk back to Pittsburgh.\\" Both Von Hayes and Steve Jeltz hit two home runs (the latter would hit only five during his Major League career) to trigger a Phillies comeback. In the eighth inning the Phillies, now trailing only 11‚Äì10, scored the tying run on a wild pitch, then took the lead on Darren Daulton's two-run single and went on to win 15‚Äì11. Rooker had to wait until after the season to make good on his \\"walk home\\" promise, conducting a charity walk from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. ==Present career== Rooker has begun a new career writing children's literature. He has currently written three books with plots that combine reading and baseball for young children. The books are titled Paul the Baseball, Matt the Batt, and Kitt the Mitt, and were published by Mascot Books in September 2009. ==References * Jim Rooker's Children's Books * Jim Rooker's career stats and analysis * www.booksbyrook.com Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:American children's writers Category:Baseball players from Oregon Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:High Point- Thomasville Royals players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:People from Lakeview, Oregon Category:Pittsburgh Pirates broadcasters Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Tiburones de La Guaira players ","title":"Jim Rooker"},{"id":"6253070","text":"Michael Maclear (1929 ‚Äì December 25, 2018) was an award-winning Anglo-Canadian journalist, documentary filmmaker, and former correspondent for various CBC programs and for CTV's W5.

Kerry, Ireland Rough Point Rough Point is one of the Gilded Age mansions of Newport, Rhode Island, now open to the public as a museum. It is an English Manorial style home designed by architectural firm Peabody & Stearns for Frederick William Vanderbilt. Construction on the red sandstone and granitehttp://www.newportrestoration.com/pr/rpfacts.html began in 1887 and was completed 1892. It is located on Bellevue Avenue and borders the Cliff Walk and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. The original gardens were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted‚Äôs firm.RP Facts The home's last owner was Doris Duke and it is currently owned and operated by the Newport Restoration Foundation. ==History== In 1894, the Vanderbilts began renting Rough Point to summer guests. William Bateman Leeds, Sr., known as the ‚ÄòTinplate King‚Äô, rented the home in 1904 and 1905. He was one of the owners of American Tin Plate Company, a tin plate trust. He purchased the estate in 1906. After he died in 1908, his wife, Nancy Leeds, used John Russell Pope to make some exterior alterations to the home. She remained the owner until 1922. Their son, William Bateman Leeds, Jr., married Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia. In 1922, James Buchanan Duke, the founder of fortunes in electric power and tobacco, and benefactor of Duke University, and his second wife Nanaline bought the house.Newport Restoration Foundation - Rough Point Estate They used architect Horace Trumbauer of Philadelphia to assist in renovating the house; two new wings were added to the home. Nanaline hired design firm White Allom to transform the home's dark interiors.RP History James died at his Fifth Avenue and 78th Street, New York City, white-limestone mansion in 1925, bequeathing his enormous fortune, along with its several residences, to his only child, 12-year-old Doris Duke. Rough Point, which came close to being sold twice at Nanaline's insistence nonetheless eventually became one of Doris' most prized properties, replete with its spectacular rocky coastal setting. Doris's memorable debutante ball was held at the estate in 1929. Mrs. Duke continued to spend her summers at Rough Point; but, after the New England Hurricane of 1938 that devastated Rhode Island, and with the advent of World War II, Mrs. Duke's visits became less frequent. In the early 1950s, Mrs. Duke took up permanent residence in New York City and emptied Rough Point of all its furnishings. By 1958, Doris Duke once again became a frequent visitor to Newport and turned her attention to refurnishing Rough Point. In 1958 and 1959 she began purchasing art and antiques for the house and combined these new pieces with family treasures. It became one of Miss Duke's favorite residences; she lived there May through November most years and continued to collect items for the house during her wide-ranging travels. In 1966, the most controversial event in Duke's entire life occurred at the estate. She and her interior designer, Eduardo Tirella, were leaving Rough Point in a station wagon. When Tirella left the car to open the front gates to the estate, Duke slid over to the driver's seat to pull the car out of the gates and wait for Tirella to close them again. Accidentally accelerating the station wagon, Duke caught Tirella with the car and dragged him across the street where he was crushed against a tree, instantly killing him. Duke was not charged with murder, and Tirella's death was recorded as an accident. Bactrian Camel Topiaries During Hurricane Bob in 1991, the house's solarium served as a shelter for Princess and Baby, Duke's two pet Bactrian camels. The camels were gifts from billionaire Saudi arms-dealer and businessman Adnan Khashoggi.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950608/ai_n13987226 Independent, The (London), Jun 8, 1995 by DAVID USBORNE The camels summered in Newport when Duke was in residence. She would often buy them peanut butter cookies in large quantities as treats. Many visitors on the cliff walk were very surprised to see Princess and Baby roaming the grounds. Rough Point is different from most of Newport's other mansions. Cottages such as The Breakers and Rosecliff have been uninhabited by socialites for nearly sixty years and when toured appear austere and museum-like. Rough Point was home to Doris Duke into the 1990s; the house maintains a clever mixture of grandeur and hominess that others lack. The house has stayed how Doris Duke left it since her death in 1993. The architectural significance of Rough Point can be attributed to Trumbauer's ability to renovate and enlarge the original structure in a seamless manner.Kathrens, Michael C. (2002) American Splendor: The Residential Architecture of Horace Trumbauer. Doris was one of several remaining Gilded Age socialite heiresses in Newport. While under the ownership of Doris Duke, the house was filled with hundreds of priceless antiques, while the drapes on her bed were bought at JC Penney. Paintings in the home include Gainsborough, Van Dyck, and Renoir. During Miss Duke's stays, staff at Rough Point would pick vegetables daily for use in the cooking. Vegetables and flowers were shipped from the greenhouses at Duke Farms in New Jersey each spring to be planted. A historical plant list of what was at Rough Point includes artichoke, squash, cabbage, lettuce, onions, peppers, spinach, eggplant, beans, okra and cucumbers. The list of herbs is long, too, including basil, chamomile, chives, dill, fennel, marjoram, parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, spearmint, tarragon, borage, and lovage. ==Currently== The property remained with Duke until her death in 1993. It was tied up in litigation for a few years and opened to the public as a museum in 2000. It is currently owned by the Newport Restoration Foundation. Tours occur from May until November. Since 2003, an exhibit has been in place, being either clothing, jewelry, silver, or furniture, changing each year. ==See also== *List of Gilded Age mansions ==References *Newport Restoration - Rough Point Category:Houses completed in 1892 Category:Landmarks in Rhode Island Category:Peabody and Stearns buildings Category:Duke family residences Category:Vanderbilt family residences Category:Museums in Newport, Rhode Island Category:Historic house museums in Rhode Island ","title":"Rough Point"},{"id":"6253143","text":"Power to the People is an album by jazz saxophonist Joe Henderson, released on Milestone in 1969, his first to feature an electric instrument. ==Track listing== All compositions by Joe Henderson, except where noted. #\\"Black Narcissus\\" ‚Äì 4:50 #\\"Afro-Centric\\" ‚Äì 7:00 #\\"Opus One-Point-Five\\" (Ron Carter) ‚Äì 4:56 #\\"Isotope\\" ‚Äì 4:53 #\\"Power to the People\\" ‚Äì 8:42 #\\"Lazy Afternoon\\" (Moross, Latouche) ‚Äì 4:33 #\\"Foresight and Afterthought (An Impromptu Suite in Three Movements)\\" ‚Äì 7:33 Recorded on May 23 (2, 5) and May 29 (all others), 1969. ==Personnel== * Joe Henderson ‚Äî tenor saxophone * Mike Lawrence ‚Äî trumpet (2, 5) * Herbie Hancock ‚Äî piano (3, 4, 6), electric piano (1, 2, 5) * Ron Carter ‚Äî bass * Jack DeJohnette ‚Äî drums ==References== Category:1969 albums Category:Joe Henderson albums Category:Milestone Records albums Category:Albums produced by Orrin Keepnews ","title":"Power to the People (Joe Henderson album)"},{"id":"6253149","text":"Zygostates is a genus of orchids widespread across much of South America from Guyana to Argentina.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The word is from the Greek Œ∂œÖŒ≥ŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ (zygostates, weigher, balance) and refers to the projections from the base of the column which resemble a balance. ==References== Category:Orchids of South America Category:Maxillarieae genera Category:Ornithocephalinae ","title":"Zygostates"},{"id":"6253169","text":"Stadionul Silviu Ploe»ôteanu, previously known as Stadionul Tineretului, is a multi-purpose stadium in Bra»ôov, Romania.

After competing in the 2000, 2001, and 2002 championships as a speaker, Fernando Rodrigo returned as a coach. Under the then Harvard freshman's guidance, the 2003 team made a strong showing by winning as many rounds in the competition as the 2002 and 2001 teams combined. Following in Fernando‚Äôs footsteps, three of the debaters also made the Top 50 Speakers list that year. Though he was no longer coach, Fernando‚Äôs continued influence and contribution became even more apparent when the 2004 team made the Quarter- Finals in Stuttgart. This proved to be a stark contrast to previous years, in which Peru was consistently ranked as one of the lowest scoring countries. Top 50 Speakers *2001: Fernando Rodrigo (41) *2002: Fernando Rodrigo (32) *2003: Katie Gushwa (39), Nicole Furman (43), Jamie McTavish (45), *2004: No list was made this year *2005: Kyle Hecht (41) *2013 Sebastian Salomon (16 ESL tab) Luis Enrique Zela-Koort (48 main tab, 8 ESL tab) Jose de los Heros (20 main tab, 3 ESL tab) *2014 Lorenzo Pinasco (9 ESL tab) Jose de los Heros (36 main tab, 5 ESL tab) Sebastian Dasso (29 main tab, 2 EFL tab) ==Peru in the Pan- American Debating Championships== Peru has also had very successful participations at the Pan-American Championships, which was created by Sixto Ramos. The first one was held in Lima, Peru in 2002 where Peru debated at the finals vs. Argentina. In 2004 for the Pan-Americans in Buenos Aires, Argentina two teams were sent: Team 1: * Jorge Luis Sarmiento (Markham College) * Nicol√°s Aguirre (Markham College) * Lorena Alarco (Newton College) * Kyle Hecht (Newton College) * Alfonso de la Torre (Colegio Santa Mar√≠a) Team 2: * Ricardo Maertens (Casuarinas) * Josefa de la Puente Colegio Roosevelt * Nicole Furman Colegio Roosevelt * Gloria Maria Gonzalez Colegio Roosevelt * Nicolas Vega Colegio Roosevelt Coach: Douglas Scott This year (2008) the Peruvian Debate Association hosted the Pan-American Championship in Lima, Peru. Delegations from Canada, Bermuda, USA, and Peru participated in a week of intense debates. Per√∫ won the championship on 2014 Held at Mexico city. Per√∫ 3, debated in the Spanish division Against delegations from Mexico, Argentina, Champagnat, and Chile. The team won 5 of the 6 preliminary debates to then start the quarter finals. In the quarter finals the decision was unanimous giving the debate to Per√∫ 3-0 against Champagnat. In the semifinals the debate was given by a unanimous decision 5-0 against Mexico. The final debate about austerity was held at the main auditorium on the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. The Decision was given unanimous to Per√∫ 5-0 against Mexico.

The protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit is shown with the N-terminus in blue at bottom and the C-terminus in red at top. A single helix-turn-helix motif is shown in the center with the outer helix in pink, the inner helix in green, and the turn in white. From . An alpha solenoid (sometimes also known as an alpha horseshoe or as stacked pairs of alpha helices, abbreviated SPAH) is a protein fold composed of repeating alpha helix subunits, commonly helix-turn- helix motifs, arranged in antiparallel fashion to form a superhelix. Alpha solenoids are known for their flexibility and plasticity. Like beta propellers, alpha solenoids are a form of solenoid protein domain commonly found in the proteins comprising the nuclear pore complex. They are also common in membrane coat proteins known as coatomers, such as clathrin, and in regulatory proteins that form extensive protein-protein interactions with their binding partners. Examples of alpha solenoid structures binding RNA and lipids have also been described. ==Terminology and classification== The term \\"alpha solenoid\\" has been used somewhat inconsistently in the literature. As originally defined, alpha solenoids were composed of helix-turn-helix motifs that stacked into an open superhelix. However, protein structural classification systems have used varying terminology; the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database describes these proteins using the term \\"alpha alpha superhelix\\". The CATH database uses the term \\"alpha horseshoe\\" for these proteins, and uses \\"alpha solenoid\\" for a somewhat different and more compact structure exemplified by the peridinin-chlorophyll binding protein. ==Structure== Alpha solenoid proteins are composed of repeating structural units containing at least two alpha helices arranged in an antiparallel orientation. Often the repeating unit is a helix-turn-helix motif, but it can be more elaborate, as in variants with an additional helix in the turn segment. Alpha solenoids can be formed by several different types of helical tandem repeats, including HEAT repeats, Armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, leucine-rich repeats, and ankyrin repeats. Alpha solenoids have unusual elasticity and flexibility relative to globular proteins. They are sometimes considered to occupy an intermediate position between globular proteins and fibrous structural proteins, distinct from the latter in part due to the alpha solenoids' lack of need for intermolecular interactions to maintain their structure. The extent of the curvature of an alpha solenoid superhelix varies considerably among the class, resulting in the ability of these proteins to form large, extended protein-protein interaction surfaces or to form deep concave areas for binding globular proteins. Because they are composed of repeating relatively short subunits, alpha solenoids can acquire additional subunits relatively easily, resulting in new interaction surface properties. As a result, known alpha solenoid proteins vary substantially in length. ==FunctionNuclear pore complex components=== Alpha solenoids feature prominently in the proteins making up the nuclear pore complex (NPC); alpha solenoid and beta propeller domains together account for up to half of the core NPC scaffold by mass. A large number of the conserved nucleoporin proteins forming the NPC are either alpha solenoid proteins or consist of a beta propeller domain at the N-terminus and an alpha solenoid at the C-terminus. This latter domain architecture also occurs in clathrin and Sec31, and was thought to be unique to eukaryotes, though a few examples have been reported in planctomycetes. ===Vesicle coat proteins=== The structure of the clathrin heavy chain leg segment showing helical repeats, with the N-terminus in blue at left and the C-terminus in red at right. Vesicle coat proteins frequently contain alpha solenoids and share common domain architecture with some NPC proteins. Three major coat complexes involved in distinct cellular pathways all contain alpha solenoid proteins: the clathrin/adaptin complex, which buds vesicles from the plasma membrane and is involved in endocytosis; the COPI complex, which buds vesicles from the Golgi apparatus and is associated with retrograde transport; and the COPII complex, which buds vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum and is associated with anterograde transport. ===Transport proteins=== Due to their propensity for forming large interaction surfaces well-suited to protein-protein interactions, and their flexible surfaces permitting binding of various cargo molecules, alpha solenoid proteins commonly function as transport proteins, particularly in transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. For example, the beta-karyopherin superfamily consists of alpha solenoid proteins formed from HEAT repeats; importin beta is a member of this family, and its adaptor protein importin alpha is an alpha solenoid formed from Armadillo repeats. Transporters of other molecules, such as RNA, can also be of alpha solenoid architecture, as in exportin-5 or pentatricopeptide-repeat-containing RNA- binding proteins, which are particularly common in plants. ===Regulatory proteins=== protein phosphatase 2A. Subunit A, consisting of 15 HEAT repeats, is shown in rainbow color with the N-terminus in blue at bottom and the C-terminus in red at top. The regulatory subunit B, consisting of irregular pseudo-HEAT repeats, is shown in light blue. The catalytic subunit C is shown in tan. (All from .) Superposed is the unbound form of the regulatory subunit B in gray (from ), illustrating the flexibility of this alpha solenoid protein. Conformational changes in HEAT repeat 11 result in flexing the C-terminal end of the protein to accommodate binding of the catalytic subunit. The protein-protein interaction capacity of alpha solenoid proteins also makes them well suited to function as regulatory proteins. For example, regulatory subunit A (also known as PR65) of protein phosphatase 2A is a HEAT- repeat alpha solenoid whose conformational flexibility regulates access to the enzyme binding site. ==Taxonomic distribution== Alpha solenoid proteins are found in all domains of life; however, their frequencies in different proteomes vary significantly. They are rare in viruses and bacteria, somewhat more common in archaea, and quite common in eukaryotes. Many of the eukaryotic alpha solenoid proteins have detectable homologs only in other eukaryotes and are often restricted even further, to the chordates. Prokaryotic alpha solenoid proteins are concentrated in particular taxa, notably the cyanobacteria and planctomycetes, which have unusually complex intracellular compartmentalization relative to most prokaryotes. ==Evolution== Evolutionary relationships between different alpha solenoid proteins are difficult to trace due to the low sequence homology of the repeats. Convergent evolution of similar protein structures from ancestrally unrelated proteins is thought to be significant in the evolutionary history of this fold class. ===Nuclear pore complexes and vesicle transport=== The nuclear pore complex is an extremely large protein complex that mediates transit into and out of the cell nucleus. Homologous structures from which the NPC might have evolved have not been detected in prokaryotic transmembrane transport proteins; however, it has been suggested that the NPC components show distinct homology to vesicle coat proteins found in clathrin/adaptin, COPI, and COPII complexes. Most distinctively, a shared domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal beta propeller and a C-terminal alpha solenoid has been detected in both NPC and coat proteins, suggesting a possible common origin. An ancestral \\"protocoatomer\\" that diversified to acquire derived characteristics of all four modern complexes has been proposed. Examination of the genome of Lokiarchaeum, thought to be among the closest archaeal relatives to eukaryotes, did not reveal any examples of the beta propeller/alpha solenoid domain architecture, although homologs of other proteins involved in eukaryotic membrane trafficking were identified. However, it is unclear whether this observation means that the propeller/solenoid architecture evolved later or was lost from modern lokiarchaea. ===Membrane coat proteins in prokaryotes=== A survey of the sequenced genomes of complex prokaryotes from the PVC superphylum (Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae) identified examples of proteins with homology to eukaryotic membrane trafficking proteins, including examples of the distinctive beta- propeller/alpha-solenoid domain architecture previously believed to be unique to eukaryotes. The PVC superphylum is known for containing bacteria with unusually complex membrane morphology, and this discovery has been cited as evidence in favor of these organisms' status as an intermediate form between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus has exceptionally complex membrane architecture and has been a source of controversy in the literature regarding the possibility that it has a membrane-bound \\"nucleoid\\" compartment enclosing its DNA. The identification of proteins with sequence similarities to HEAT repeats in the G. obscuriglobus proteome has been interpreted as support for the membrane-bound nucleoid hypothesis; however, this has been disputed. ==Bioinformatics== Low sequence similarity among alpha solenoid proteins of similar structure has impeded their identification using bioinformatics methods, since the repeats are often not well defined in sequence. A large number of different computational methods have been developed to identify candidate alpha solenoid proteins based on their amino acid sequence. == External links == *RepeatsDB Œ±-solenoid class ==References== Category:Protein folds ","title":"Alpha solenoid"},{"id":"6253251","text":"River Falls Mall is a shopping center in Clarksville, Indiana, on Lewis and Clark Parkway (formerly State Road 131). From its opening in 1990 until 2006, the center was an enclosed mall, with of gross leasable area. It originally comprised multiple entertainment venues and retail. After losing the majority of its tenants, River Falls Mall was redeveloped in 2006 as a power center, comprising Dick's Sporting Goods, Old Time Pottery, Jo-Ann Fabrics, and Bass Pro Shops. ==History== River Falls Mall opened in 1990, across from the existing Green Tree Mall and comprising of retail space. It included Walmart and Bacon's as its anchor stores, as well as several entertainment venues, such as miniature golf and bumper cars. Dawahares (later All About Sports) and Toys \\"R\\" Us also operated within the mall. When Bacon's parent company was acquired by Dillard's in 1998, Dillard's operated its men's clothing, children's clothing, and housewares departments in the former Bacon's building, while retaining women's clothing at the Green Tree Mall store. Although the mall struggled with high vacancy for most of its existence, the addition of a Dick's Sporting Goods in 1999 briefly increased occupancy to 92 percent. Bass Pro Shops entered negotiations with Chicago-based mall owner General Growth Properties in 2002 to open a store at the mall. Negotiations were completed and construction on the Bass Pro Shops store was started in early 2004. Dillard's closed its store around this time, returning all of its departments to the Green Tree Mall location, as had been the case before the River Falls store opened. Soon afterward, the movie theater closed, and Walmart moved out of the mall to a new Supercenter. Dick's Sporting Goods then moved out of the middle of the mall and into the former Walmart. In 2005, Bass Pro Shops opened, displacing most of the mall itself. Toys \\"R\\" Us, the former Dillard's, and the former Walmart were all left standing. Since the opening of Bass Pro Shops, the mall has been \\"de-malled\\", and turned into a power center consisting of big-box stores. Subsequent openings include Old Time Pottery and Louisville Athletic Club, both of which displaced portions of the former Walmart wing. A brand new movie theater, Great Escape River Falls 12, opened in November 2006. The rest of the former mall structure between Dick's Sporting Goods and Bass Pro Shops has become Old Time Pottery, Louisville Athletic Club, hhgregg (closed 2017), and Jo-Ann Fabrics. Toys \\"R\\" Us was the only holdover still in its original location from when it was an enclosed mall, however after the company's bankruptcy in 2018, Toys \\"R\\" Us has since closed. ==References== Category:Clarksville, Indiana Category:Shopping malls in Indiana Category:Defunct shopping malls in the United States Category:Shopping malls established in 1990 Category:Power centers (retail) in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Clark County, Indiana Category:Tourist attractions in Clark County, Indiana ","title":"River Falls Mall"},{"id":"6253266","text":"Air powered (fireless) locomotive on display at Bankhead, Alberta. Bankhead Railway Station, now relocated to Tunnel Mountain Road in Banff Ruins of the Lamp House at Bankhead Bankhead, Alberta was a small coal mining town that existed in the early twentieth century, in Banff National Park, near the town of Banff, Alberta. The mine was located at Cascade Mountain, which contains high grade anthracite coal deposits. The Bankhead coal mine was operated by the Pacific Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which needed the coal to fuel its steam engines. The mine began operations in 1903 and was the first anthracite mine in Canada. A local newspaper report published 17 June 1922 indicated that notices of the closure of the Bankhead Mines had recently been posted through that town. The notices made it clear that on and after 15 July the staff of Bankhead Mines would not be required and the coal operations would cease. The report concluded: \\"This would indicate that after the above date Bankhead will be a dead town so far as coal mining is concerned.\\" This report concluded that no reasons were given for the closure, although it was generally understood that mining there had not been profitable. There had been a strike at the mine two months before this announcement, and the mines had been closed since that time. Another report on the mine closure noted that around 200 to 300 men were employed there with the output of coal running between 500 and 600 tons per day. The town population was around 1,000 people. All of Bankhead's buildings were built and owned by the company and rented to the residents. In 1926, many of the town's buildings were moved to Banff and Canmore. The Bankhead Railway Station now sits on the grounds of the Banff Hostel on Tunnel Mountain Road. It has a map of the Bankhead townsite posted outside its front door. Today, an interpretive trail runs through Lower Bankhead. Signs are placed along the trail identifying the major buildings, as well as other interesting facts. Many foundations of buildings are visible. One building remains intact and contains displays viewed through the windows. Remains of the town are also visible adjacent to the Upper Bankhead parking lot. Bankhead is located on the Lake Minnewanka road, just a few minutes drive from the Banff townsite or the Trans Canada Highway. Near Bankhead was another coal mine, Anthracite. This mine was a failure because of heavy water inflow in the underground. The Anthracite mine shut down in 1904 and was abandoned. ==See also== *List of ghost towns in Alberta ==References *Ghost towns. Bankhead - Alberta, Canada Ghost Town *Bankhead Mines, 1904.

The total investment reached eleven and a half million dollars, allocated to equipment and conditioning of the facilities. The total property has 200,000 square meters, of which 9,098 are covered. From there, he began his productive activities in October 2008 with the production of his first chassis for a 12-ton bus with a rear engine. The production was diversified in January 2009 with the production of a bus chassis with front engine, later another 17-ton bus chassis, in June it produced the light truck 7500 and in July the first minibus. In addition to this line, Agrale Argentina developed a prototype locally for both urban and medium-distance transport. In May 2009, the plant obtained the ISO Quality Certification. In mid-2009 the company had invested more than 12 million dollars in our country, employing 56 people directly between their productive and administrative activities. In October 2009, the then governor Scioli completed the official presentation of the Industrial Plant Mercedes of the firm Agrale Argentina SA in National Route No. 5 at the height of kilometer 89. After finishing 2015, it recorded a record in its local production (more than 1300 units) in its Mercedes plant installed more than 10 years ago in the province of Buenos Aires and with a record also in its turnover in sales, Agrale Argentina, manufacturer of trucks, buses and tractors.http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/01/agrale.html ===Trucks=== *Agrale 6000 *Agrale 8500 *Agrale 9200 *Agrale 13000 *Agrale A8700 *Agrale A10000 ===Buses=== *Agrale 8.5 *Agrale MA 12.0 *Agrale MA 15.0 *Agrale MT 12.0 SB *Agrale MT 15.0 LE *Agrale MT 17.0 LE ===Tractors=== *Agrale BX 6180http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/03/agrale- bx-6180.html *Agrale BX 6150http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/03/agrale-bx-6150.html *Agrale BX 6110http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/03/agrale- bx-6110.html *Agrale 7215http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2016/03/agrale-7215.html *Agrale 575.4http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/07/agrale-5754.html *Agrale 575.4 Compacthttp://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2015/11/agrale-5754-compact.html *Agrale 5105.4http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2015/11/agrale-50154.html *Agrale 5105http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/07/agrale-5105.html ==See also== * List of trucks ==References * Agrale website ** Linctec official site * Agrale of Argentina * Venta de Repuestos Agrale en Chile www.Novoparts.cl * Buses Volare, Fabricados con Chasis Agrale.

In June 1864 he was given command over the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where guerrillas had carried out attacks against Unionists. He imposed martial law and was criticized for punitive actions against persons accused of being guerrillas. ==Early life== Burbridge was born in 9 August 1831 in Georgetown, Kentucky.\\"Stephen Gano Burbridge\\", Paul David Nelson, \\"American Civil War: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection\\", Volume 1, A-C, editor Stephen C.

Wright, \\"The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies\\", Routledge, 2013, 78 ==Civil War== Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, Burbridge organized the 26th Kentucky Infantry Regiment and joined the Union Army as the regiment\`s colonel. After serving as brigade commander in several campaigns, and winning the Battle of Cynthiana against John Hunt Morgan, in June 1864 Burbridge was given command of the District of Kentucky to deal with the growing problem of Confederate guerrilla campaigns. He imposed martial law, authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. His command was likened by some residents to an extended period of military siege that would last through early 1865. On July 16, 1864, Burbridge issued Order No. 59 which declared: \\"Whenever an unarmed Union citizen is murdered, four guerrillas will be selected from the prison and publicly shot to death at the most convenient place near the scene of the outrages.\\" During Burbridge's rule in Kentucky, he directed the imprisonment and execution of numerous people, including public figures, on charges of treason and other high crimes. His opponents said that many of these were baseless. While continuing in charge of Kentucky, in October 1864, Burbridge led Union assaults against the salt works near the town of Saltville, Virginia as part of the first Battle of Saltville. Their attack did not succeed. Among his forces were colored cavalry, later organized that fall as the 5th United States Colored Cavalry Regiment. A number of wounded cavalry were murdered on the battlefield by Confederate soldiers and guerrillas from Tennessee; others were killed while being treated at a field hospital set up at Emory and Henry College. These related incidents were known as the Saltville Massacre, a war crime for which Ferguson was prosecuted in October 1865 and sentenced to death by hanging.Encyclopedia Virginia: \\"Saltville During the Civil War\\" During the 1864 presidential campaign, Burbridge tried to ensure re-election of Lincoln, by suppressing support in Kentucky for Democratic candidate George B. McClellan. His actions included arresting prominent persons favoring the candidate, including Lieutenant Governor Richard T. Jacob, and Judge Bullitt, both of whom he deported to Richmond, Virginia, by then under Union control. After a falling out with Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, which included an attempt to take control of his troops and arms in February 1865, Burbridge was dismissed from his role of commander in Kentucky. Bramlette had quickly complained by telegram to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, writing: > This unwarranted assumption of power by an imbecile commander is doubtless > instigated by those who have long sought to provoke an issue with the State, > and which I have prevented. Lincoln revoked Burbridge's order. He replaced him with Major General John Palmer. Burbridge soon resigned from the army. ==Later years== After the war, Burbridge moved to Brooklyn, New York. He died there on December 2, 1894. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. ==Gallery== File:Confederate Martyrs JTown 1.jpgImage of the Confederate Martyrs Monument in Jeffersontown, Kentucky for the four Confederate soldiers executed by Burbridge File:Confederate Soldiers Martyrs Monument in Eminence 3.JPGConfederate Soldiers Martyrs Monument in Eminence of Eminence, Kentucky for the three Confederate soldiers executed by order of General Burbridge File:Gen.

It was not until 1961 when it was renamed into Avanhard (Avangard) Stadium. In 1967, the Avanhard Stadium could hold 40,000 spectators. In 1974, there were installed running tracks. In 1986, due to modernization, the stadium's capacity was reduced to 32,243. In 2002, the stadium ownership has changed when it was transferred from Luhanskteplovoz to the Luhansk Oblast Administration. In 2003, there were conducted major renovations to the stadium's facilities, because of that its capacity was reduced to 22,288. In 2011, there was replaced the turf, installed drainage and heat systems.

All are located along the Sulphur Mountain Thrust Fault below Devonian limestones. The water is heated geothermally from an estimated depth of three kilometres. The Cave and Basin is the only cavern large enough to comfortably accommodate groups of people. ==History== The entrance to the Cave and Basin building. Human habitation in this area can be traced back to 10,700 years BP with the retreat of the last great glaciation, and it is unlikely that the hot springs escaped being noticed. The first recorded reference to hot springs here is by James Hector of the Palliser Expedition in 1859, followed by Joe Healey in 1874 who found the Cave and Basin site in 1875. But it was Canadian Pacific Railway workers William McCardell and Frank McCabe who brought national attention to the Cave and Basin. In 1883 they descended through the skylight entrance into the cave using a felled tree, and the following year constructed a small cabin nearby with the intention of commercializing the Cave and Basin site. Conflicting claims by other parties prompted intervention by the Canadian government headed by John A. Macdonald, and in 1885 an order-in-council reserved around the Cave and Basin, the Banff Hot Springs Reserve. This was the genesis of Canada's national parks system. In 1886 the Canadian government held an inquiry into the various private claims to settle on compensation. In 1886 an artificial tunnel was driven into the Cave and Basin to aid visitation. In 1912 bottled water from the Cave and Basin site was sold for its alleged curative powers. In 1914 a naturally heated swimming pool was opened to the public and continued to operate until 1994. The Cave and Basin was formally declared a national historic site in 1981. Canada's national parks system celebrated its centennial in 1985, on the anniversary of the order-in-council that established the original reserve around the Cave and Basin. ==Facilities== The built facilities include an artificial tunnel to natural grotto, a replica of the original 1887 bathhouse, the restored 1916 swimming pool and structure, interpretive displays, hiking and snowshoe trails. The 1887 bathhouse, the first structure on the site, proved inadequate by 1902, and a new pool was built in 1904. The stone bathhouse was completed in 1914, designed by architect Walter S. Painter. The pools were closed in 1975, restored in 1985, then closed again in 1992. An interpretive center now uses the structures. The Banff Upper Hot Springs is a separate facility some southeast of the Cave and Basin. Many of the early structures were built by detainees held at a World War I Ukrainian Canadian internment camp located nearby. The camp held citizens of countries with which Canada was at war at the time, and had a significant Ukrainian contingent. A permanent exhibit about Canada's first national internment operations was opened at the Cave and Basin site, postponed three months by extensive flooding across southern Alberta, on 13 September 2013, with an address by Jason Kenney, Minister of Employment and Social Development and Minister for Multiculturalism. ==Environmental== Banff snail, approximately 3‚Äì5 mm. Almost all of the delicate cave formations had been stripped out of the Cave and Basin immediately following its 'discovery'. According to articles in the Calgary Herald at the time, the construction of the artificial tunnel was contentious even in 1887. In 1924 western mosquitofish were introduced into the hot springs in an attempt to control mosquitos. Tropical fish illegally introduced into the lower springs by local aquarium enthusiasts may have contributed to the extinction of the Banff longnose dace. Cave and Basin hot springs are also notable as the habitat for the Banff Springs snail, listed as an endangered species in 2000 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. ==Gallery== Cave and Basin National Historic Site 01.jpgCave and Basin National Historic Site Cave and Basin National Historic Site 02.jpgCave and Basin National Historic Site Cave and Basin National Historic Site 03.jpgCave and Basin National Historic Site Cave and Basin National Historic Site 04.jpgCave and Basin National Historic Site Cave and Basin National Historic Site 05.jpgCave and Basin National Historic Site ==References== * Caves of the Canadian Rockies and Columbia Mountains J Rollins, Rocky Mountain Books, 2004 * Physical and Chemical Properties of the Sulphur Mountain Thermal Springs, Banff National Park, and Implications for Endangered Snails Stephen E.

This is the computer model on which TSS/360 would have run The IBM Time Sharing System TSS/360 is a discontinued early time- sharing operating system designed exclusively for a special model of the System/360 line of mainframes, the Model 67. Made available on a trial basis to a limited set of customers in 1967, it was never officially released as a supported product by IBM. TSS pioneered a number of novel features, some of which later appeared in more popular systems such as MVS. TSS was migrated to System/370 and 303x systems, but despite its many advances and novel capabilities, TSS failed to meet expectations and was eventually canceled. TSS/370 was used as the basis for a port of UNIX to the IBM mainframe. TSS/360 also inspired the development of the TSS-8 operating system. == Novel characteristics == TSS/360 was one of the first implementations of tightly- coupled symmetric multiprocessing. A pair of Model 67 mainframes shared a common physical memory space, and ran a single copy of the kernel (and application) code. An I/O operation launched by one processor could end and cause an interrupt in the other. The Model 67 used a standard 360 instruction called Test and Set to implement locks on code critical sections. It also implemented Virtual Memory and Virtual Machines using position-independent code. TSS/360 included an early implementation of a \\"Table Driven Scheduler\\" a user-configured table whose columns were parameters such as current priority, working set size, and number of timeslices used to date. The kernel would refer to this table when calculating the new priority of a thread. This later appeared in systems as diverse as Honeywell CP-V and IBM z/OS. As was standard with operating system software at the time, TSS/360 customers (such as General Motors Research Laboratories) were given full access to the entire source of the operating system code and development tools. User-developed improvements and patches were frequently incorporated into the official source code. == User interface == TSS provides users a command-line interface. Users interact with the command system. The command format consists of \`Command_Name[ operands]\`. The command name is one to eight characters without imbedded blanks. The operands are optional depending on the command, and must be separated from the command name by at least one blank. Multiple operands should be separated by TAB characters or commas. Command lines can be continued by typing a hyphen (\\"-\\") at the end of the line to be continued and typing the continuation at the beginning of the next line. Multiple commands can be written on a line by separating them with semicolons (\\";\\"). Comments are allowed in command lines, separated from the command with a semicolon and included in single quotes (\\"'\\"). Operands can be either positional or keyword, with the format \\"keyword=value\\". System commands are divided into seven categories: * Task management ‚Äì LOGON, LOGOFF, ABEND, etc. * Data management ‚Äì CATALOG, DDEF, DELETE, etc. * Program management ‚Äì LOAD, DUMP, DISPLAY, TRAP, etc. * Command creation ‚Äì PROCDEF, BUILTIN * Message handling * User profile ‚Äì SYNONYM, DEFAULT, PROFILE, etc. * Program product language interface ‚Äì ASM (Assembler (F)), COBOL, HASM (Assembler (H)), PLI (PL/I (F)), PLIOPT (PL/I Optimizing Compiler), FTNH (FORTRAN (H)), etc. == Position-independent code == TSS provided an early implementation of position-independent code, the ability to have different processes run a single copy of an executable possibly mapped to a different virtual addresses in each process. Each procedure may have a read-only public CSECT, a writable private Prototype Section (PSECT) and a writable save area, typically located in the PSECT. Address constants of external procedures and entry points must be located in the PSECT, since the dynamic loader will not place a routine at the same virtual address in every process. A program that follows Type I linkage conventions is generally responsible at entry for saving its registers in the save area pointed to by register 13, retrieving the address of its PSECT from word 19 of the save area, chaining the save area to a new save area and putting the address of the new save area in register 13. A caller that follows Type I linkage conventions loads a V-constant for the routine into General Register 15 (GR15) and copies an R-constant for the routine's PSECT into the 19th word of the save area pointed to be GR13 prior to calling that routines. When the dynamic loader loads a program, it makes a copy of the PSECT and relocates the adcons to reflect the virtual addresses assigned within the current process, therefore each user of the program has a unique copy of the PSECT. The Dynamic Loader does not load program pages or resolve address constants until the first page fault. == Criticism == TSS/360 suffered from performance and reliability problems and lack of compatibility with OS/360, although those issues were eventually addressed. IBM attempted to develop TSS on a very aggressive schedule with a large staff of programmers to compete with Multics. By 1967, it had become evident that TSS/360 was suffering from the same kinds of delays as OS/360. In February 1968, at the time of SHARE 30, there were eighteen S/360-67 sites attempting to run TSS. During the conference, IBM announced via \\"blue letter\\" that TSS/360 was being decommitted a great blow to the time- sharing community. This decision was temporarily reversed, and TSS/360 was not officially canceled until 1971. However, TSS/360 continued to be quietly available for a time to existing TSS/360 customers, as an interim measure. After TSS/360 was canceled, IBM put its primary efforts into the Time Sharing Option (TSO), a time-sharing monitor for OS/360. Several other groups developed less ambitious, more successful time sharing systems for the S/360-67, notably CP-67 at IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center, an early virtual machine monitor which evolved into VM/370, MTS at the University of Michigan, and ORVYL at Stanford University. IBM also provided the TSS/370 PRPQ as a migration path for existing TSS/360 customers, which went through multiple releases. == See also == * History of IBM mainframe operating systems * Time- sharing system evolution * History of operating systems * Operating systems timeline == References  Further reading == * Describes the origin and schedule problems of TSS. * Describes the \\"second system syndrome\\" that affected TSS. == External links == * Public domain software archive, includes TSS/370 source and binary archives * TSS/360 manual archive at BitSavers.org, contains PDFs for a large number of TSS manuals from IBM Category:IBM mainframe operating systems Category:Time-sharing operating systems Category:Discontinued operating systems Category:1967 software Category:Computer-related introductions in 1967 Category:Assembly language software ","title":"TSS (operating system)"},{"id":"6253370","text":"Waddington is a small village located in the Selwyn District of the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island, near the Waimakariri Gorge. ==Description== Waddington was named by and for William Waddington, who purchased part of the Homebush run previously held by John Deans and laid out the township in 1873. Waddington has a close association with its neighbouring village Sheffield, which is further north-west along State Highway 73. The two villages share a community committee. The two villages have a combined population of 444 according to the 2001 New Zealand census and are located between Darfield and Springfield on State Highway 73 and the Midland Line railway. The towns were settled in the 19th century by farmers attracted to the area for sheep grazing. Waddington is situated at the intersection of three major roads (two of them popular tourist roads) servicing the inland regions of Canterbury, including the Inland Scenic Route and the Great Alpine Highway / State Highway 73. Waddington's cemetery was initially called the East Malvern Cemetery, but in 1880 the trust changed its name to Waddington Cemetery Trust. The first burial was in 1882.

Born in Scotswood, Newcastle upon Tyne Barclay is best remembered for his time at Sheffield United for whom he played in the 1936 FA Cup Final, but also had spells for Derby County and Huddersfield Town. Barclay also represented England on three occasions, scoring two goals. ==Football careerDerby County=== Barclay started his career with amateur clubs; Scotswood United Church, Bell's Close Amateurs, Allendale and finally Scotswood before signing for Derby County in 1928 where he became a prot√©g√© of George Jobey. He spent two seasons with The Rams scoring 23 league goals in 61 games. ===Sheffield United=== In 1931 Barclay signed for Sheffield United for ¬£3,500. He was cool and methodical in his play, very clever, and was bought to lend inspiration to Jimmy Dunne in attack, although he also provided plenty of openings for the other attacking teammates (like inside-forward Jack Pickering). He remained a stalwart at Bramall Lane and was an important figure in the Blades FA Cup side of 1936, appearing in the final in which United lost 1‚Äì0 to Arsenal. Barclay scored 67 league goals for The Blades in 231 starts, although it has been said on numerous occasions that he given his apparent unselfishness in front of goal, he should have scored many more. ===Huddersfield Town=== In March 1937 Barclay was transferred to Huddersfield Town along with Eddie Boot for a combined fee of ¬£7,000. He was a regular for Town in the following seasons and once again found himself on the losing side at Wembley as Huddersfield were beaten 1‚Äì0 by Preston North End in the 1938 FA Cup Final. With the outbreak of World War II the football league was suspended but Town retained Barclay's registration throughout. As was common in this period Barclay made wartime guest appearances for Barnsley, Bradford Park Avenue, Bradford City, York City, Crewe Alexandra, Oldham Athletic and back at his old club Sheffield United. With the war over Barclay was finally released by Huddersfield in 1946 having scored 19 goals from 74 league appearances. ==International career== Barclay's good form with Sheffield United meant it was no surprise when he was handed his first of 3 England international caps in 1932. He made his debut against Scotland on 9 April 1932 in a Home Championship aged 25 years. Scoring on his debut Barclay found the net again in England's next game later the same year; another Home Championship fixture, this time against Ireland. Despite this promising start he was overlooked until 1936 when he won his third and final cap in another Home Championship game against Scotland. ===International goals=== { class=\\" collapsible\\" style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:left; margin:auto;\\" ! # !!

During all promotional appearances, their faces are masked by drawings resembling themselves as printed by a dot-matrix printer. ==History== Beat Crusaders, commonly abbreviated BECR, was founded at the end of 1997 by T≈çru Hidaka, as an experimental U.S. Lo-Fi Indie Rock unit. The rest of the band later joined as a result of continual experimental gigs performed around the Shimokitazawa area of Tokyo. Their creative use of analog synthesizers and an old Casiotone, incorporated with influences of such bands as Weezer and The Rentals, and at times the dynamism of Snuffesque rock, had transformed them into a powerfully melodic guitar band. By the end of 1998, Beat Crusaders had become known for a crazy and fun live act that was not to be missed. The momentum continued with a single, \\"E.C.D.T.\\" released in June of the following year which entered independent charts of CD retail shops all across Japan. A month later their first mini-album, Howling Symphony of... was released; this entered the charts again with various music magazines giving a big thumbs up. Reflecting their chart action and praise from magazines, numerous gigs followed with notable bands in the Japanese alternative/independent scene, from guitar pop and new wave, to pop punk and ska bands. They continued to be busy, with their second single \\"Firestarter\\" released in early 2000, and the full-length album, \\"All You Can Eat\\". They also were involved in four compilations, including an shared EP entitled WXY, with songs from Japanese punk band Captain Hedgehog. In August 2003, three of the four original members of Beat Crusaders left the band, to eventually go on to form the band Anita Chili Peppers. This left behind only T≈çru Hidaka who later recruited four new members. It is not known why the original members left, but it doesn't seem like they left on bad terms, considering Hidaka included the masks of his former bandmates and his actions (he was crying) in the PV, \\"Sensation\\". Later on, their song \\"Hit in the USA\\" was used for the opening of the BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad anime, which moved the band into the Japanese mainstream. Since then they released several more albums, including a cover album of American and British songs entitled \\"Music Crusaders.\\" Their song \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" was used as the fourth opening of the Bleach anime. In 2006, the band's music made its first American appearance as the opening theme song, \\"Hey x 2 Look x 2\\" (AKA \\"Hey Hey Look Look\\") to the Nicktoons animated series Kappa Mikey. The single \\"Winterlong\\" was also used as the opening of the Hero Tales anime. A full- length CD EPopMaking, was released on May 30, 2007, with 19 tracks, followed by Popdod on June 4, 2008. In 2010, Toru Hidaka confirmed that Beat Crusaders would break-up, but promised to release one more album. Titled Rest Crusaders, it was released on October 6, 2010, with 22 tracks of both new songs, old singles like \\"Windom\\", and previously released but recent singles like \\"Let It Go\\" and \\"Situation\\". ==Members== * - vocals, guitar * - bass * - guitar * - drums * - keyboard ;Former members *umu (real name ) - bass, vocals *araki (real name ) - drums, vocals *thai (real name ) - keyboard, guitar, vocals ==DiscographyStudio albums=== {  !Title !Year !Label - Howling Symphony Of... 1999 rowspan=\\"5\\"Lastrum - All You Can Eat 2000 - Foresights 2001 - Sexcite 2002 - BEST CRUSADERS 2003 -  rowspan=\\"2\\"2005 rowspan=\\"6\\"DefSTAR - P.O.A. -POP ON ARRIVAL- -  2007 - popdod 2008 - REST CRUSADERS 2010 - LOST CRUSADERS 2010 } ===Singles=== {  !Title !Year !Label !Notes - Never Pop Enough EP 1999 rowspan=\\"4\\"Lastrum  - \\"Firestarter\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"2000  - \\"Handsome Academy\\"  - \\"Capa-City\\" 2002  - \\"Girl Friday\\" 2003 rowspan=\\"2\\"Captain Haus \\"Follow me\\", as one of the songs for BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. - \\"Sensation\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"2004  - \\"Hit in the USA\\" rowspan=\\"9\\"DefStar For BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad - \\"Feel\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"2005  - \\"Love Potion No. 9\\"  - \\"Day After Day/Solitaire\\"  - \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\"  - \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" 2006 The fourth opening for the Bleach anime - \\"Hey Hey Look Look\\" 2006 The opening theme for the Kappa Mikey TV show - \\"Ghost\\" 2007  - \\"Chinese Jet Set\\" 2008  - \\"Winterlong\\" 2008 rowspan=\\"1\\"DefStar The opening of Juushin Enbu (Hero Tales) - -  In collaboration with Ayano Tsuji 2008 rowspan=\\"1\\"Speedstar Theme song of third Keroro Gunso movie - \\"Let It Go\\" 2009 rowspan=\\"2\\"DefStar  - \\"Situation\\" 2010  - } ===EP/Misc=== {  !Title !Year !Type !Label - Best Crusaders 2003 Best Of Album Lastrum - Compi Crusaders '68-'77 vol. 37 rowspan=\\"2\\"2005 Compilation rowspan=\\"3\\"DefSTAR - Musicrusaders Cover Album } ===Compilations=== {  !Title !Year !Type !Label - VERY BEST CRUSADERS 2009 Best Of Album DefSTAR } ===Split albums=== {  !Title !Year !Split With !Label - WXY 2001 Captain Hedge Hog rowspan=\\"3\\"Lastrum - Diggin' in the Street rowspan=\\"2\\"2002 Rude Bones - Ozzy!!

(German:Deckungsbeitrag) It maximizes the profit derived from a company's assortment, based on the difference between a product's price and variable costs (the product's contribution margin per unit), and on one's assumptions regarding the relationship between the product's price and the number of units that can be sold at that price. The product's contribution to total operating income is maximized when a price is chosen that maximizes the 'contribution margin per unit X number of units sold'. ==Theoretical basis== Contribution margin per unit is the difference between the price of a product and the sum of the variable costs of one unit of that product. Variable costs are all costs that will increase with greater unit sales of a product or decrease with fewer unit sales (as opposed to fixed costs, which are costs that will not change with sales level over an assumed possible range of sales levels). Examples of variable costs are raw materials, direct labor (if such costs vary with sales levels), and sales commissions. The contribution margin per unit of each product multiplied by units sold equals the contribution to profit from sales of that product, and the total of Contributions to Profit from all a firm's products minus the firm's fixed costs equals the firm's operating income. Therefore, using the simplified example of a single-product firm, a firm would maximize profit by determining the price that maximizes contribution to profit (i.e., contribution margin per unit multiplied by the number of units sold), since the fixed costs that will next be subtracted will, by definition, be a constant regardless of the number of units sold. Due to the relative differences in order size and the efforts that a retailer or distributor have to make, different industries have different typical distribution margins. Alliance experts - How to calculate a reasonable distributor margin and reseller margin?, http://www.allianceexperts.com/en/knowledge/what-is-a-reasonable-margin-for- your-distributor/ Assuming an inverse relationship between price and sales volume, as is the case for most products since a lower price will generally induce higher unit sales, the firm would assume likely unit sales levels at various price levels, calculate the contribution margin per unit for the product at each of those price levels, multiply the number of units by the corresponding Contribution Margin Per Unit at that price level and choose the highest Contribution to Profit to maximize profit. ==Relative contribution margin and Opportunity Cost== The relative contribution margin refers to the use of a production factor that is required for the generation of the contribution margin: :Relative Contribution = Product's Contribution to Profit/Production factor If there is a bottleneck for a production factor within a company, and this factor may be used to produce multiple products, the relative contribution margin can be used to calculate which product exploits the factor most efficiently and should therefore be produced. An example is the time used on a certain production machine. The relative contribution margin (also referred to as a bottleneck specific contribution margin), shows you the Opportunity Cost in the event that you decide not to produce the product. ==Use in retail: Rekenen in Centen, in Plaats van Procenten== :Selling Price ‚àí Buying Price Per Unit = Contribution Margin Per Unit (cm) :Contribution Margin Per Unit x Units Sold = Stock Keeping Unit's Contribution to Profit (CM) :Contributions to Profit From All SKU's ‚àí Firm's Operating Expenses = Total Firm Profit The relative contribution margin, such as contribution per square meter (GMROS) indicates the Opportunity Costs in the event that one decides against the sale of a certain product on that selling area. Using this system, the gross margin percentage is considered irrelevant for merchandising decisions.Leading By Design: The Ikea Story, Author Bertil Torekull Publisher HarperCollins, 1999 , 9780066620381 In 1906, C&A;, the clothing retailer owned by the Brenninkmeijer family, stopped trying to increase gross margin percentages. They fixed the margin at 25% for decades and increased relative contribution per piece in stock per time period. Later, when selling different commodities they shifted to relative contribution per square meter. They called this . ALDI used relative contribution margin based pricing per stock keeping unit from the very beginning in the 1950s. ==Limitations== This approach determines the price that maximizes profit only for an individual product, and only over a given time horizon. There are factors other than profit maximization for an individual product that a firm must consider in setting the price for each product, particularly if they have multiple products. These include: *Impact on sales of other products of the firm (complementary sales; cannibalization; impact on brand image; impact on distribution or trade push of the firm's other products; competitor reaction affecting the firm's other products). *The strategic role of the product and others in the product portfolio (price points and positioning of the other products; each product's role in the firm's cash flow). *Plans to replace or modify the product (and hold distribution in the meantime). *Economies of scale and scope, and experience curve effects on costs. *Long-term strategy for the product. ==References== Category:Pricing ","title":"Contribution margin-based pricing"},{"id":"6253423","text":"Flag of Poltava Oblast.

It features police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn. It is set primarily in Ramah Reservation (part of the Navajo Reservation) and the Zuni village in New Mexico, both in the American Southwest. Two boys are missing from the Zuni school. One boy is a Navajo, so Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is called in to find him while the Zuni police seek the other boy. The Zuni boy's body is found, brutally murdered. Tracks of the other boy are found at the scene. This Navajo boy is a well-trained hunter who has to skip school some days to hunt to feed himself, his father and his brother. He seeks spiritual guidance, as well, being the only Navajo boy in his class at school. He is a challenge for Leaphorn, the most skilled tracker, to find, especially once he realizes who the killer is, and the search moves to a major Zuni ceremony. The story contrasts Zuni and Navajo beliefs through the two boys and the two policemen. The Zuni believe in something like heaven after death, where the Navajo encourage the people to do their best on earth, as their chindi, the worst of a person, will be a ghost left behind after death. The two tribes reside in the same area for hundreds of years, yet use the land differently, Zunis preferring a town while Navajos spread out over the land, and have sharply contrasted beliefs as to the after life. This is played out in the bellagana culture, with ambitious anthropologists, the drug trade, the FBI, and narcotics officers. ==Plot summary== Ernesto Cata is in training to play his role as Shulawitsi the Fire God in an upcoming Zuni religious ceremony. He sees a kachina that can be seen by the initiated, which he is not, or by those about to die. The next day, his friend George Bowlegs leaves school early, after learning Ernesto is not there. Lt. Joe Leaphorn works with the Zuni police chief Pasquaanti, who seeks Ernesto, while Leaphorn will seek George, a Navajo boy. A patch of blood-soaked soil is found at the meeting place where George was returning Ernesto's bicycle. That is the starting point in the search for the two boys. Near the home of the Bowlegs, Leaphorn is approached by George's younger brother Cecil, who tells him that George is running away from the kachina, the one that got Ernesto. Cecil says that Ernesto had stolen some flints from the dig site. Next, Leaphorn talks with Ted Isaacs, who is about a mile from where the blood was found, at an anthropological dig site under the aegis of Professor Reynolds. Reynolds is ambitious to prove that Folsom Man culture continued longer than the accepted notions of its duration. Isaacs tells Leaphorn of the success in the field work. Reynolds bars Isaacs from having his girlfriend Susanne with him, and barred Ernesto and George from the site a few days earlier. When questioned, Reynolds denies any thefts from the site. Checking out Jason's Fleece, Leaphorn sees a Zuni kachina, rather unexpected next to the abandoned Navajo death hogan now housing the commune. He meets Susanne, who confirms that George was afraid of something and asking questions about absolution in the Zuni religion. Leaphorn learns that Ernesto's body has been found. Pasquaanti and Ernesto's family dig up the boy's body, while Leaphorn examines the area to learn how the bike and the boy were brought there. After the funeral, Leaphorn visits the hogan of the Bowlegs, where he sees someone slipping away and then discovers the body of George and Cecil's father Shorty. Cecil returns by horse after getting the sheep in. Leaphorn gathers what Cecil needs, as their family home must now be abandoned as a death hogan. One item cannot be found, a note from George to Cecil. Leaphorn leaves Cecil at the Franciscan mission. Speaking again with Susanne, Leaphorn picks up the phrase ‚Äòdance hall‚Äô as where George means to go, which Father Ingles explains in terms of Zuni practices. Father Ingles tells Leaphorn how George was searching for a religion, a place to belong. Leaphorn shares with the priest how Ernesto died, by beheading. Leaphorn finds Susanne hitchhiking. She joins him in the search for George, at a lake in Arizona. They find his horse's tracks, and then a deer killed for a meal, but not George. At every site there are moccasin prints, but Leaphorn has not found the man who wears moccasins. Then he recalls the stolen note, and knows for certain that the killer of Ernesto is at this same place. Leaphorn gets caught in a trap designed to tranquilize a deer but meant for George. Before he is taken over by the drugs he tells Susanne how to use his pistol, and while he is incapacitated by the drugs, she uses it. It is dawn before the drugs have left Leaphorn's system and he can walk about. They leave the site without finding George. Leaphorn meets with two of the six law enforcement agencies now involved in this case, three local and three federal; the FBI has the lead and is certain that the murders are tied to illegal drug movements. Leaphorn knows who the killer is now and shares his information with Pasquaanti. He seeks George in the Shalako ceremonial at the Zuni village in the falling snow. Leaphorn sees George in the crowds but is one step behind the man who kills George. The killer is pulled into a doorway, having interfered with sacred Zuni ceremonies, and is never seen again. The next day, Leaphorn explains to Ted Isaacs that Reynolds had been ‚Äúsalting‚Äù the dig sites, so the field results would support his theory, and Reynolds is dead. Ernesto had taken some items from Reynolds' box and shared them with George; this meant the secret will come out. Reynolds' choice was to kill all in his way, the boys and Shorty Bowlegs. The FBI seeks sellers of illegal drugs and does not care about the dead boys or the old flints; the professor will soon be a missing-persons case, having been dealt his justice by Zuni law. It is left to Isaacs to decide how important his career is to him now, compared to his girl, last seen at the Zuni police station being questioned by the FBI. Leaphorn did find George, but not in time to save his life. Young Cecil will settle with relatives of his father. ==Characters== * Joe Leaphorn: Navajo Tribal Police Lieutenant; man with strong skills in tracking people. * Ed Pasquaanti: chief of the Zuni tribal police. * Ernesto Cata: young Zuni boy, 12 years old, follows both Catholic and Zuni practices * Cecil Bowlegs: George Bowlegs' younger brother, 11 years old. * George Bowlegs: young Navajo boy at the mainly Zuni school, 14 years old, friend of Cata and older brother of Cecil, considered strange as he wants to be a Zuni when he is a Navajo, but also a mystic, one who sought God. He skips school some days to hunt for food for his family. * Shorty Bowlegs: father of George and Cecil, serious alcoholic who does not provide well for his sons. * Susanne: a caring young woman, friend of George Bowlegs, living in a Hippie commune at the start of the novel, left school in the 10th grade, about 17 or 18 years old in the story. * Ted Isaacs: graduate student of anthropology, excavating Professor Reynold's Folsom sites. * Chester Reynolds: Professor of Anthropology and graduate advisor to Isaacs, an academic with a strong reputation and too much ambition. * Father Ingles: Franciscan priest at the Saint Anthony's Mission School which all three boys attended. * Halsey: leader of Jason's Fleece, the Hippie commune where Susanne lives when the story opens. * John O'Malley: FBI agent, whom Leaphorn considers to be typical of all FBI agents. * Baker: federal drug enforcement agent, or \\"narc\\". ==Themes== Themes of the book include the Zuni religion, the long history between the Navajo and the Zuni, contrasts between Zuni and Navajo culture and origin stories, and the contrast between white man's ways and the Navajo way. ==Title== The title is a loose translation of a Zuni concept, Kothluwalawa. Dancing is what one does when there is no work to do, or a concept of heaven, a celestial space, or of life after death. Young George was seeking that as a place, not a concept, where he might learn more. His Navajo upbringing offered no notion of heaven, so his language offered no word for this Zuni concept. ==Reviews and literary significance== Kirkus Reviews finds that Hillerman portrays Indians with affection and dignity: > Navajo Lt. Joe Leaphorn of The Blessing Way who walks and talks softly is > back again trying to find out why a youngster, George Bowlegs, also a > Navajo, is missing while his friend from the adjacent Zuni reservation has > been killed. George, a strung out, lonely kid with mystical inclinations, > has been most recently attracted to the Zuni kachinas and there are more > earthly things to consider -- an archaeological dig and a commune-narcotics > drop. Not too seriously -- the story's not the thing -- it's Hillerman's > anything but wooden Indians and the way in which he informs their way of > life with affection and dignity. The novel is the subject of an article by Brewster Fitz, where he remarks that Hillerman's \\"Navajo policemen, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, are, however, probably the only non-Anglo or non-European detectives to date whose educations include academic degrees in anthropology.(2) Hillerman has explained that this formal study of anthropology, in which his detectives engaged before joining the Navajo Tribal Police, provides them with a credible knowledge of the technicalities of Native American culture and religion about which the average Navajo would not be able to talk. One of Hillerman's goals in including this detailed cultural information in a popular literary form is to instruct his readers, amusing them while helping them understand that the Native American peoples of the Southwest, far from being \\"primitive savages,\\" have a sophisticated and admirable cultural heritage.(3) In other words, in his novels Hillerman seeks to fight the ethnocentrism and ignorance that have dominated in the majority view of Native American cultures.\\" ==Awards== Dance Hall Of The Dead received the 1973 Edgar Award for Best Novel. ==Allusions to Real Events and Cultures== The author includes a note about how to view what Joe Leaphorn learns about the Zuni religion and Shalako ceremonies, in the course of the novel. > In this book, the setting is genuine. The Village of Zu√±√≠ and the landscape > of the Zu√±√≠ reservation and the adjoining Ramah Navajo reservation are > accurately depicted to the best of my ability. The characters are purely > fictional. The view the reader receives of the Shalako religion is as it > might be seen by a Navajo with an interest in ethnology. It does not pretend > to be more than that. In the course of the story, much of the Navajo origin myths and specific cultural practices (e.g., death hogans abandoned if the dead person lay there a while before being buried) are described, and often aspects are contrasted to what Leaphorn or Father Ingles understands of Zuni practices (e.g., the role of the kachinas (meaning kachina dancers not dolls) and kachina masks in Zuni culture, the presence or absence of a notion of life after death). The story reflects the newly emerging drug culture of the US and the phenomenon of hippie communes for younger people wanting to test new ways of living. It contrasts Susanne, a young white woman tossed out of home by her father with George and Cecil, Navajo boys whose mother was not present and whose father was alcoholic, leaving George to support the family while going to school. ==Geography== In his 2011 book Tony Hillerman's Navajoland: Hideouts, Haunts, and Havens in the Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee Mysteries, author has listed the following 11 geographical locations, real and fictional, mentioned in Dance Hall of the Dead. #Corn Mountain, NM #Coyote Canyon #Coyote Wash, NM #Gallup, NM #Nutria Lake, NM #Ojo Caliente, NM #Ramah, NM #Shiprock (Community), NM #Zuni Pueblo, NM #Zuni Mesa (fictitious location) #Zuni Wash or Zuni River, NM & AZ ==See also== * McKinley County, New Mexico * Painted Desert, Arizona * Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation * Zuni Indian Reservation ==References Bibliography == * ==External links== * Dance Hall of the Dead at Tony Hillerman Portal at University of New Mexico library Category:1973 American novels Category:Novels by Tony Hillerman Category:Edgar Award-winning works Category:Novels set in Arizona Category:Novels set in New Mexico ","title":"Dance Hall of the Dead"},{"id":"6253438","text":"Maes-y-Dre Recreation Ground Maes y Dre Recreation Ground is a multi-use stadium in Welshpool, Powys, Wales.

A Democrat, she is a member of the Connecticut Senate representing the 5th district, which includes part of Bloomfield, most of Farmington, all of Burlington and all of West Hartford. Bye served two terms in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. ==Early life and education== Bye was born and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. She graduated from St. Mary's High School (that school is now Trinity Catholic High School in Stamford) in Greenwich in 1980 and from the University of New Hampshire with a master of arts degree in child development in 1989. In 2013, Bye completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. ==Professional and political career== Beth Bye was appointed as Commissioner for the Connecticut Office of Early Childhood by Governor Ned Lamont in January 2019. Bye, who served in the Senate from 2011 to the present and in the House from 2007 through 2010, will lead an office created in 2013 to coordinate and enhance various early childhood development programs and create a cohesive early care system. In 2013, Senator Bye led the effort to create The Office of Early Childhood (OEC), one of the first such offices in the country. Her work as champion for the creation of the office is informed by her own, long-term experience since 1980 as an early childhood professional. Beth‚Äôs experience includes leadership positions at Auerfarm/Wintonbury Early Childhood Magnet School, Great by 8, the Capitol Region Education Council, and she also helped to open two early childhood magnet schools.

Commissioner Bye received her BA and MA in Child Development from the University of New Hampshire. ===Connecticut State Legislature=== A former Vice Chair of the West Hartford Board of Education, she was elected to the legislature in November 2006. She defeated Republican Barbara Carpenter, a member of the town council, by a margin of 57% to 43% and was therefore elected to succeed longtime Republican incumbent Bob Farr. Although the district had elected a Republican for the 26 years prior to her 2006 win, she nevertheless won re-election comfortably in 2008: Bye garnered 64% of the vote to her Republican opponent's 36%. In May 2010, shortly after Sen. Jonathan Harris (D-West Hartford) announced that he would not run for another term in the senate in order to seek the Democratic nomination for secretary of the state, Bye declared her candidacy for his senate seat. She won the Democratic nomination unopposed and easily prevailed against a Republican opponent. She took office as a state senator on January 5, 2011. In January 2019, then-incoming Governor Ned Lamont appointed Bye to lead the state Office of Early Childhood leading her to resign from the state legislature. ==Personal life== A lesbian, Bye married Conard High School Dr. Tracey Wilson on November 12, 2008.

Penningby Castle, backside. Penningby Castle () is a medieval-period private castle located the L√§nna parish of Norrt√§lje Municipality in Uppland, 70 kilometres north of Stockholm, Sweden. Penningby situated in the valley near Edsviken, a narrow inlet in the Saltsj√∂n bay of the Baltic Sea . ==History== One of the most well-preserved castles from the Vasa era, the Penningby Manor is first mentioned in the 1380s. To the northeast is an overgrown ruin castle with a moat, which may be the remains of a predecessor to the castle. Its earliest owners included Lord Tord Bonde, burgrave of Raseborg and margrave of Viborg. In late 15th century, a fortress was built by its owners, initiated by Lady Birgitta Tordsdotter Bonde, daughter of Tord Karlsson (Bonde), Lord High Constable of Sweden. The medieval castle was a so-called twin house unusual in its placement near the sea coast. The immense tower was erected just before the 1550s under Lord Lars Turesson, Tre Rosor. In his time, the eastern fa√ßade got a new entrance. Later, the sea tower got its round salon, arguably the most beautiful room in the castle.Penningby slott (Stockholms l√§ns museum) In 1805 countess Maria Juliana von Rosen had the castle garden recreated in a so-called English style. In 1831, a fire destroyed the interiors of the castle, but parts of it, for example the ceiling, were restored, and the tower was modified. A section of the medieval walls are yet left. A restoration was carried out from 1951 to 1953. Penningby castle was declared a national cultural heritage (byggnadsminne) in 1980. Today the castle is not inhabited, but visitors may have access to it in summers. Olof Persson Stille, one of the early settlers in New Sweden, was employed on the Penningby Manor. In 1641 Olof Stille, a millwright by trade, was the original owner of the area which is today Eddystone, Pennsylvania. Stille was one of the four commissaries or magistrates appointed to administer justice among local inhabitants, and thus became a judge of the first court on the banks of the Delaware River.Olof Persson Stille and his Family (Dr. Peter Stebbins Craig.

This brand replaced Autolite as Ford's official parts brand. Autolite has continued since and is still a brand name in use today, but is no longer owned by or affiliated with Ford. It is currently owned by FRAM. Motorcraft was originally launched in the 1950s with and was temporarily discontinued after Ford had purchased the Autolite trade name and utilized it as their primary auto parts brand. ==Today== Motorcraft-sponsored NASCAR racecar Today parts are designed and engineered to fit for installation on Lincoln, Mercury, and Ford vehicles. Some parts, such as Motorcraft's extensive list of oil filter applications, fit a wide variety of makes/models not built by Ford Motor Company. Motorcraft products are sold through Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships, as well as select auto parts stores. Many times, Ford will approach a contract manufacturer of a particular product (many times a supplier to the company already) and work with them to create a version for sale under the Motorcraft name. These products must meet quality standards set by the Ford Motor Company to be considered for retail sale. Other brands such as Mazda use Motorcraft products in vehicles which both partner when producing. Although Motorcraft can only be contacted through the Ford website, Motorcraft parts and products can sometimes be used on other non-Ford vehicles. ==Motor oil== Motorcraft also sells motor oil for automotive use. As of the late 2000s, most of their oil is a synthetic blend or fully synthetic. Several weights are available, from 0W-20 all the way to 15W-40 for diesel engines. ==Automatic transmission fluid== Beginning in 1987, Motorcraft sold automatic transmission fluid under the MERCON brand namehttps://www.aftermarketnews.com/ford-announces-new- replacement-specs-for-mercon-atf/ Ford Announces New Replacement Specs for Mercon ATF for automotive use.

By September 1921, SR 32 was proposed on the Alma‚ÄìBaxley segment. SR 17 was proposed from Baxley through Lyons to Swainsboro. It was also placed on the Louisville‚ÄìWrens segment. SR 24 was designated on the Louisville‚ÄìAugusta segment, via Wrens. By October 1926, US 1 was designated on the current path. The route of SR 15 between Alma and Hazlehurst, including its concurrency with US 1, was shifted to the east-northeast. SR 32 was designated on the Alma‚ÄìBaxley segment, with a concurrency with US 1/SR 15 from Alma north to a point southwest of Baxley. By October 1929, SR 4 was designated on the current path. The eastern terminus of SR 32 was truncated to Alma. SR 15's southern terminus was removed from US 1 and truncated to the northern end of its former concurrency with US 1 north of Alma, at what is the current northern end of the concurrency that US 1/SR 4 have with US 23\\\\. SR 24's Louisville‚ÄìAugusta segment was shifted to the southeast to travel between Louisville and Waynesboro. SR 17's southern terminus was truncated to Wrens. ===1930s=== In January 1932, the southern terminus of SR 17 was extended on US 1 and SR 4 from south-southeast of Wrens to Louisville and then to the southeast to Midville and then east-southeast to Millen. In the first third of 1937, SR 23 was extended west-southwest from Folkston to Saint George, but there was no indication of a concurrency with US 1/SR 4. The 1938 GDOT map was the first one that had an inset map of Augusta. It indicated that US 1 and SR 4 entered the main part of the city on Deans Bridge Road, like it currently does. It intersected US 78/SR 10/SR 12 (Milledgeville Road). This intersection was the eastern terminus of SR 12 at the time. US 1, US 78, SR 4, and SR 10 followed Milledgeville Road to the east-southeast. They intersected US 25/SR 21 (Savannah Road). This intersection was the northern terminus of SR 21 at the time. The five highways traveled northeast on Twiggs Street. They curved to the north-northeast onto 7th Street (listed as \\"Seventh Street\\" on the map). At SR 28 (Broad Street), US 25 turned left to the west-northwest, while US 1, US 78, SR 4, and SR 10 turned right to the east-southeast. At an intersection with 5th Street, the four highways split off of SR 28 to the north-northeast and traveled to the South Carolina state line. At the end of 1939, SR 57's eastern terminus was extended from Swainsboro to just north of Oak Park, forming a concurrency with US 1 and SR 4 between the two points. ===1940s and 1950s=== In the first quarter of 1940, the northern end of the segment of SR 17 concurrent with US 1 and SR 4 north of Louisville was shifted north- northeast to Wrens. Between January 1945 and November 1946, SR 46 was placed on a concurrency with US 1/SR 4 in Oak Park. By March 1948, US 301 was placed on its concurrency with US 1/SR 4 between Florida and Homeland. Between April 1949 and August 1950, US 23 was placed on its current concurrency with US 1/SR 4 and US 301. Between September 1953 and June 1954, US 221's northern terminus was extended from southwest of Louisville into South Carolina, including its concurrency with US 1/SR 4 and SR 17 from Louisville to Wrens. Between June 1954 and June 1955, US 1, US 78, and SR 4 were indicated to have split off from US 25 at the southern terminus of 7th Street to continue following Twiggs Street to the northeast. They turned right onto Calhoun Street (now part of Walton Way) and followed it to the east-southeast to 5th Street. From that intersection, they resumed their north-northeast direction. By July 1957, SR 4 was shifted off of US 1 and US 78 in Augusta. It was indicated to follow Deans Bridge Road, Milledgeville Road, and Twiggs Street like before, with US 1 and US 78, along with US 25, US 278, and SR 10 was shifted onto Gordon Highway. SR 4 was shown to follow 7th Street to Broad Street, but there was no indication as to whether if followed US 25 north/SR 28 west or US 25 south/SR 28 east. Between July 1957 and June 1960, SR 21 was extended along SR 4 from the meeting point of Milledgeville Road, Savannah Road, and Twiggs Street, and followed Twiggs Street and 7th Street to Broad Street, along with SR 4\\\\. US 25 was shifted off of Broad Street and followed US 1, US 78, US 278, and SR 10 along Gordon Highway to the state line. Its former path on Broad Street and 13th Street was redesignated as US 25 Bus. ===1960s=== By June 1963, SR 15 was shifted to its current concurrency with US 1/US 23/SR 4 between Florida and Racepond and on US 1/SR 4 from Baxley to South Thompson. SR 121 was extended south-southeast along US 1/US 23/SR 4 (and SR 15) from Racepond to Folkston. By 1966, SR 88 was extended to the Sandersville area, thereby traveling on a concurrency with US 1/US 221/SR 4 and SR 17 in Wrens. The 1966 GDOT map was the first one with an inset map of Waycross. It indicated that US 1/US 23/SR 4 entered the city from the southeast on Memorial Drive. They began a concurrency with US 84/SR 50\\\\. At Plant Avenue, US 84 split off to the southwest. US 1, US 23, SR 4, SR 38, and SR 50 traveled to the northeast. At Albany Street, SR 50 split off to the west-northwest. At this intersection, US 82 joined the concurrency. At State Street, US 1, US 23, and SR 4 split off to the northwest. A northwestern bypass of Waycross, from US 82/SR 50 at the midway point between Waresboro and Waycross to US 1/US 23/SR 4 south-southeast of Dixie Union. In Augusta, SR 12 was extended along SR 4, along Milledgeville Road, where it ended at SR 21 (Savannah Road). From the 7th Street‚ÄìBroad Street intersection, SR 21 was shown to have followed US 25 Bus./SR 28 to the west-northwest on Broad Street to 13th Street and then on 13th Street to the South Carolina state line. That year, SR 4 was removed from US 1 in the Wadley and Louisville areas. Its former path in each city was redesignated on US 1 and US 221 as SR 4 Bus. The next year, US 1 in both Wadley and Louisville was shifted eastward, onto SR 4\\\\. The former path on SR 4 Bus. was redesignated as US 1 Bus. ===1970s and 1980s=== In 1978, a southern bypass of the main part of Waycross, designated as SR 714, was proposed from SR 122 west-southwest of the city to US 1/US 23/SR 4 southeast of it. In 1980, SR 12's eastern terminus was truncated off SR 4 to end at its intersection with SR 4. The next year, SR 12's eastern terminus was further truncated to its current location, near Thomson, with the part of Milledgeville Road that is not part of SR 4 relinquished to local control. Also, the northern terminus of SR 21 was truncated to Millen. SR 4's path in Augusta was shifted to its current path. In 1982, a proposal to extend SR 714 was shown to have extended from just south of SR 122 north-northwest to US 82/SR 50 east-southeast of Waresboro (meeting the bypass road for the northwestern part of Waycross), and then west-northwest to another meeting point with US 82/SR 50 on the western edge of Waresboro. Between January 1984 and January 1986, the path of US 82 and SR 50 was shifted onto Reynolds Street, Jane Street, Francis Street, and the path of SR 714\\\\. US 84 was shifted onto Reynolds Street, as well. In 1988, the eastern terminus of SR 50 was truncated to Dawson. Its former path, on US 82 and US 84, was redesignated as SR 520. ===1990s to 2010s=== In 1992, a northwestern bypass of Waycross, designated as SR 896, was proposed from US 82/SR 520 east-southeast of Waresboro to US 1/US 23/SR 4 north-northeast of Waresboro. In 1995, the path of US 1, US 23, and SR 4 through the Waycross, Georgia micropolitan area was shifted to the west, replacing the route of SR 896\\\\. The former path was redesignated as US 1 Bus., US 23 Bus., and SR 4 Bus. In 2002, a southwesterly bypass of Swainsboro was proposed from the intersection of US 1/SR 4 and SR 297 south-southeast of the city to US 1/SR 4 north-northwest of it. In 2004, the path of US 1 and SR 4 through the Swainsboro area was shifted to the west, onto the proposed bypass. Their former path was redesignated as US 1 Bus./SR 4 Bus. GDOT announced to the public that the portion of US 1/SR 4 between the southern part of Wrens and the interchange with I-520 was also designated as SR 540, as part of the Fall Line Freeway, on September 24, 2018. ==Major intersectionsSpecial routesWaycross business loop=== US 23/SR 4 State Route 4 Business (SR 4 Bus.) is a business route of SR 4 partially in the city limits of Waycross. It is concurrent with US 1 Bus. and US 23 Bus. for its entire length. US 1 Bus./SR 4 Bus. was established in 1996, replacing the old mainline US 1/SR 4 through Waycross, via Memorial Drive, Plant Avenue, State Street, and Alma Highway. Except for the far northern end, the entire length of SR 4 Bus. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. ===Alma spur route=== State Route 4 Spur (SR 4 Spur) was a spur route of SR 4 that existed in the Alma area. It was established between the beginning of 1945 and the end of 1946, from SR 32 just west of the city to US 1/US 23/SR 4 north of it. In 1953, a local road was established from US 1/US 23/SR 4 south of Alma to SR 4 Spur/SR 32 just west of the city. In 1976, SR 4 Spur was extended around the southwestern and southern edges of the city. In 1980, it was redesignated as SR 4 Alt. ===Alma alternate route=== US 23/SR 4 State Route 4 Alternate (SR 4 Alt.) is a alternate route of SR 4 in Alma that travels south-to-north through the western part of the city. It is the only current special route of SR 4 that is not concurrent with a special route of US 1\\\\. It begins at an intersection with the US 1/US 23/SR 4 mainline (Pierce Street) just south of the main part of Alma, although US 23 is not signed here. It travels to the west-northwest on South Dixon Street and immediately curves to the northwest. Just past an intersection with the eastern terminus of Oak Street and the southern terminus of South Thomas Street, SR 4 Alt. begins to gradually curve to the north-northwest. Just past an intersection with South Church Street, it passes an office of the Bacon County Department of Family and Children Services. It then intersects SR 32 (West 16th Street). At an intersection with the western terminus of West 15th Street, the alternate route curves to the north-northeast. At an intersection with 12th Street, it passes the Bacon County Courthouse and its local name changes to North Dixon Street. Just south of Wall Street, it curves to the north-northwest for nearly one block. At an intersection with West 11th Street, it curves back to the north-northeast. An intersection with 6th Street leads to the Alma, Bacon Co., GA Historical Society. Just north of an intersection with the northern terminus of Mercer Street, it begins a curve to a nearly due north direction. The highway crosses over Bear Branch. It then curves to the east-northeast and intersects US 1/US 23/SR 4 (North Pierce Street). Here, SR 4 Alt. ends, and the roadway continues as Camellia Drive. In the mid-1940s, SR 4 Spur was established on this same highway, but only on the part north of SR 32. In 1976, SR 4 Spur was extended to its southern terminus. In 1980, it was redesignated as SR 4 Alt. ===Swainsboro business loop=== State Route 4 Business (SR 4 Bus.) is a business route of SR 4 that is partially within the city limits of Swainsboro. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) for its entire length. The entire length of SR 4 Bus. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. In 2003, a western bypass of Swainsboro was proposed. The next year, US 1/SR 4 were shifted onto this bypass. Their former path through the city was redesignated as US 1 Bus./SR 4 Bus. ===Wadley business loop=== State Route 4 Business (SR 4 Bus.) is a business route of SR 4 that is mostly within the city limits of Wadley. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) for its entire length. It travels north through the heart of downtown, while the main route of US 1/SR 4 heads through the eastern part of the city. In 1966, SR 4 Bus. was established from US 1/SR 4 south-southeast of Wadley to US 1/SR 4 north of it. The next year, US 1 Bus. was established on the route of SR 4 Bus. ===Louisville business loop=== State Route 4 Business (SR 4 Bus.) is a business route of SR 4 completely within the city limits of Louisville. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) for its entire length. In 1966, SR 4 through the city was shifted off of US 1\\\\. Its former path became SR 4 Bus. The next year, US 1 was shifted off of SR 4 Bus. and onto SR 4\\\\. Its former path was redesignated as US 1 Bus. ==See also== * * ==References== 004 Category:Transportation in Charlton County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Ware County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Bacon County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Appling County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Toombs County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Emanuel County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Jefferson County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Richmond County, Georgia Category:Waycross, Georgia micropolitan area Category:Transportation in Augusta, Georgia ==External links== * ","title":"Georgia State Route 4"},{"id":"6253476","text":"Micro Cars is an automobile company based in Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka, founded in 1995.
