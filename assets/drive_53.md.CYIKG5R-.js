Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 64 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" In a positive review, Los Angeles Timess Robert Lloyd praised the series saying, \\"The excellence of the acting and the admirable, one might almost say English naturalism of the production balance the sometimes improbable, even implausible action and the occasional sacrifice of sense to drama; it is true that in life, people do not act sensibly, but fictional characters should be held to a higher standard of consistency. Still, the writing gives the actors a lot to play with.\\" In a more mixed critique, TV Guides Liam Mathews discussed the show's various sub- plots saying, \\"They writers are much more interested in the vignettes that build out the town...These smaller side stories give the show an indie movie- like texture about people trying to make it in America. They're sort of like short films within the bigger show, and they contain much of the show's best writing and acting. They would be better if they didn't have the unnecessary dollar bill gimmick connecting them all, but it's not that distracting.\\" In an outright negative assessment, The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman criticized the series saying, \\"There's not enough good writing here, not enough motivation to follow characters that are either intentionally half-baked or are merely uninteresting. Characters have quirks, but the quirks prove there's not much else there. Smart people eventually do exceptionally dumb things.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2010s American drama television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:CBS All Access original programming Category:Television series by Anonymous Content Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Mystery drama web series Category:Thriller web series Category:Television shows filmed in Pennsylvania Category:Television shows filmed in Pittsburgh ","title":"One Dollar (TV series)"},{"id":"56680980","text":"The L.B.

Walter Abeykoon (1901-1982) was the Senior Assistant Registrar at the University of Ceylon and the first Registrar at the Vidyalankara University, Kelaniya. Abeykoon having served in the Ceylon Civil Service for many years, was appointed as Inspector General of Police (IGP) on 1 May 1959 by his personal friend and bridge partner, Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The appointment was highly controversial as the Prime Minister appointed Abeykoon from outside the service by-passing a number of senior career police officers, on the basis Abeykoon was a Sinhala Buddhist. Senior police officers protested and DIG C. C. Dissanayake tendered his resignation, which was later withdrawn. The appointment was made by Bandaranaike after removed the then IGP Osmund de Silva the first Ceylonese to be appointed as IGP from within the force, who had refused Bandaranaike's requested for police intervention against trade union action occurring at Colombo Harbour. De Silva declined to do the Prime Minister's bidding on the basis that he believed the request was not lawful. On 24 April 1959, de Silva was compulsorily retired from the police force with Abeyakoon subsequently appointed in his place. In 1962, when an coup d'√©tat attempted by senior officers of the military and police, Abeykoon was caught off guard. Early warning from one of conspirators allowed the government to respond in time. In 1963, then Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike replaced Abeykoon with DIG S. A.

Rulers sung by Kalladar include Ambarkilan Aruvandhai, Mullur king Kari, Ori, Akdhai, Pandiyan Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, Venkatamalai ruler Kalvar Koman Pulli, Poraiyatru Kilan Periyan, Nannan, and Kalangaai Kanni Narmudicheral. Other poets who also sung about the Pandiyan King Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, including Kudapulaviyanar, Mangudi Kilar, and Mangudi Marudhanar, were thus his contemporaries. With his friendship with Mamulanar, he formed part of the Kallada‚ÄìMamulanar dyad. ==Contribution to the Sangam literature== Kalladar has written verses in Kurunthogai (verses 260 and 269), Agananuru (verses 9, 63, 113, 171, 199, 209, 333), and Purananuru (verses 23, 25, 371, 385, 391). The chief themes that Kalladar handled in his verses include battlefield, consequences of battles, and the plights of widows of the slain soldiers. He has also composed verse 9 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai. He is believed to have written a commentary on the Tolkappiyam.

Naim was Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991 and played a crucial role in the 1991 Operation Solomon which airlifted around 14,200 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in a single day. == Early life and education == Naim was born in Tripoli, Libya, and he moved to Israel with his family in 1944. He graduated from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and held a master's degree in Jurisprudence. == Career == Naim has served in Israel's Foreign Ministry from 1956 until his retirement in 1999. He started his career as a cultural and press Attach√© in Tokyo (1956 - 1960), where he had also taught Hebrew at Tokyo University. In 1960, he was sent to Kenya, which was then a British colony but in the process of gaining independence, in the hope of building diplomatic relations with Kenya once it became an independent state. While in Kenya, Naim worked closely with Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta, who later became the first president of Kenya, and paved the way to fruitful relations between Kenya and Israel. Naim later served in Washington D.C. from 1968 to 1973 as an assistant to Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin and then as the consul general of Israel in Philadelphia from 1976 to 1981. Later, Naim served as an Ambassador in Finland from 1988 to 1990, and then in Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991. After a brief stint at the United Nations, he completed his career as Ambassador to South Korea from 1992 to 1995. == Operation Solomon == In 1990, Ethiopia's long-lasting civil war came to an end, and the Mengistu government was about to be toppled. Israel was concerned for an ancient community of Jews (Beta Israel) who have been living in Ethiopia for three thousand years. which was the main reason that Naim was sent to Ethiopia. Naim was instrumental in the process of negotiating with Ethiopia's then President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Operation Solomon was launched on May 21, 1991. It involved 41 flights, 37 airplanes, lasted for 25 hours, and 14,200 Ethiopian Jews were taken to Israel. Because of Naim's crucial role in Operation Solomon, he was awarded the highest recognition by Israel's President Chaim Herzog. == Legacy == After evacuating thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel, absorbing the immigrants to the mainstream Israeli society became the greatest challenge. Although officially retired in 1999, Naim continued to draw support for Ethiopian Jews, the group of people that he had helped save. Naim, along with other mainly American philanthropists, founded a scholarship fund (Keren Hanan Aynor Foundation) to support young Ethiopians who lived in Israel and wished to attend college and graduate schools. ==Death== Asher Naim passed at his home in Jerusalem after a long illness on November 11, 2016.

He moved to Ipetumodu when he reached school age and attended several primary schools until he finished his primary school education at Christ School in 1951. He worked as a store clerk at Ipetumodu, Edunabon and Sekona until 1955 when he taught for one year at Christ Apostolic Church School, Ifetedo. From there, he gained admission into the Divisional Teacher Training College, Ile-lfe, where he obtained the Grade 3 Teachers' Certificate in 1957. He taught for the next two years until he went to St. Andrew's College, Oyo where he obtained his Grade 2 Teachers' Certificate in December, 1961. He went back to teaching and ended up at CAC. School, Ikire, as the headmaster in 1966. He remained in Ikire Area for the rest of his working career, working in Ikire and Ikoyi as a teacher and headmaster in many primary, modern and secondary schools until he retired in 1989. Except for the one year he spent at the University of Lagos in 1972 on a teacher's diploma course in Yoruba Studies, Adegoke spent all his adult working life in and around Ikire. Adegoke developed a keen interest in sports very early in life. Everywhere he taught from 1955 until he retired in 1989, he was popular as a games master, leading many of his schools' teams to victory not only in athletics but also in football. It was in football that he became well recognised, not only as a technical Aaviser to the Oyo State Sports Council, but also as a member of the Nigerian Referees' Association, of which he became the National Vice President from 1988 to 1989. He was a member of the 1st Osun State Sports Council and handled many important national and international football matches. An avid student of Yoruba culture, Adegoke was interested in the cultural life of the people. His achievements in this field date back to the old days of the Western Region Festival of the Arts which used to take place in Ibadan. In 1964, his dancing group represented Ife Division at the Festival. The group presented Oluro dance and came second in the Cultural Dance category. ==Reign== Adegoke's journey to the throne began in 1970 when he unsuccessfully contested for the vacant stool of Apetumodu. He was not discouraged, and when the stool became vacant again in 1986, he made his interest known. This time he was successful. His candidature was agreed upon by the kingmakers on 20 October 1988. After a successful court case, His Royal Eminence Oba Okunade Sijuwade Olubuse II, Oluaye and Ooni of Ife, consented to Adegoke's appointment on 4 March 1992. The then Executive Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Isiaka Adetunji Adeleke, gave the formal approval of the Osun State Government on 10 April 1992. Adegoke was installed as the 25th Apetumodu of Ipetumodu on 17 April 1992, from which date he was confined to Ilofi where he was prepared for traditional roles. He remained in Ilofi until 17 July 1992, when he moved to the Aafin.http://dailypost.ng/2017/11/27/osun-monarch- apetumodu-dies-80/ During his reign, Ipetumodu was peaceful and witnessed appreciable development. Federal Government Girls College, Oduduwa University and Akinola International Market, Magistrates Court, District Customary Court, and Immigration Office were established. ==Personal life== Adegoke had children and grandchildren. He died in November 2017. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Nigerian traditional rulers ","title":"James Adedokun Adegoke Akunraaledoye II"},{"id":"56681334","text":"Dario Caviezel (born 12 July 1995) is a Swiss snowboarder.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of September to December 108 as the colleague of Quintus Pompeius Falco. Until the discovery of an inscription bearing a list of the offices he held, all that was known about him was the year of his consulate and an anecdote forming the subject of one of Pliny the Younger's letters. His cursus honorum is known from an inscription found between 2011 and 2014 at Vasio (modern Vaison-la-Romaine) in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis; this has led some experts to suspect this was Bruttianus' hometown.¬ß185 Marcus Titius Lustricus Bruttianus, Database of Military Inscriptions and Papyri of Early Roman Palestine, text, translation, and bibliography (last accessed 24 February 2018) The first office Bruttianus is known to have held was as quaestor of Achaea; this inscription also states he was military tribune for an unknown legion, but it is uncertain whether he held that commission before or after his quaestorship. Upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy, Bruttianus would have been enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: aedile and praetor. He is also attested as having been appointed legatus or assistant to the proconsular governor of Africa. After stepping down from the praetorship, he was twice legatus or commander of two legions. This was an unusual arrangement, and Anthony Birley was able to list only thirty-three men known to have commanded more than one legion -- which did not include Bruttianus.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 18-20 The first was Legio I Italica, which served in Trajan's Dacian Wars. The second was likely Legio X Gemina.The inscription reads \\"Legio X Augustae\\", but no such unit is otherwise known to have existed. Since \\"Augustae\\" means \\"of the emperors\\", this can be construed to refer to \\"Gemina\\", which means \\"twins\\". During his command, Bruttianus demonstrated heroism which resulted in the award of dona militaria by the emperor Trajan. Bruttianus was also governor of two provinces: the public province of Achaea, and the imperial province of Cilicia. Pliny's letter that recounts an event in Bruttianus' life has been dated around the years 106-7, which was prior to his consulate. He caught a close friend, Montanius Atticinus, engaging in criminal activity and reported it by letter to Trajan; Atticinus responded by making an accusation against Bruttianus. According to Pliny, who was a juridicus at the hearing, Bruttianus presented his will, which was written in Atticinus' handwriting, as proof that they were intimate friends, then presented clear evidence of the other's crimes, which apparently involved tampering with legal documents and the subversion of a clerk's slave. Trajan ruled against Atticinus, and banished him to an island. Pliny notes that Bruttianus' reputation for honesty was strengthened and his fame increased.Epistulae, VI.22 The inscription attests to a number of offices Bruttianus held after his consulate. He was general of the army in Germania Superior and Inferior, then admitted to the Septemviri epulonum, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods, and finally was commander of the army in Roman Judea and Roman Arabia. == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Achaea Category:Roman governors of Cilicia Category:Epulones of the Roman Empire Lustricus Bruttianus ","title":"Marcus Titius Lustricus Bruttianus"},{"id":"56681383","text":"Stacey Bent is a professor of Chemical Engineering and Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (VPGE) at Stanford University.

It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to twenty small, green to greenish-yellow, sweetly scented, widely spaced flowers. It often grows with large populations of other Microtis orchids but only flowers after fire. == Description == Microtis familiaris is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and twenty green to greenish-yellow flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long, about wide and are sweetly scented. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped with a small point on the tip and is long, wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped, long, about wide and turn back with their tips clasping the ovary. The petals are about long, wide and are partly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, long, about wide and parallel to the ovary with a saddle-shaped callus in its centre. Flowering occurs from December to January but only after fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis familiaris was first formally described in 1990 by Robert John Bates from a specimen collected at Boat Harbour near Denmark and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The specific epithet (familiaris) is a Latin word meaning \\"of a family or household\\" or \\"domestic\\", referring to the observation that this orchid often grows with other Microtis species. ==Distribution and habitat== The coastal mignonette orchid grows in swampy heath in coastal areas between Augusta and Esperance in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Microtis familiaris is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * familiaris Category:Prasophyllinae Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1990 ","title":"Microtis familiaris"},{"id":"56681966","text":"Manfred Feher was a male Austrian international table tennis player.

It has been found in deposits from the Cambrian period (Atdabanian epoch). It is classified in the family Strabopidae of the monotypic order Strabopida. It contains two species, P. hamiltoni from Sweden and P. makowskii from Poland. The generic name is composed by the Ancient Greek words œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœåœÇ (palai√≥s), meaning \\"ancient\\", and ŒºŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ (m√©ros), meaning \\"part\\" (and therefore, \\"ancient part\\"). Paleomerus is one of the oldest arthropods, being sometimes interpreted as the model of the first arachnomorphs. It is part of the order Strabopida, a poorly known group closely related to the aglaspidids of uncertain affinities, often being ignored by researchers and authors due to the poor preservation and abundance of their fossils. It has been suggested that Paleomerus and the closely related Strabops could be synonymous with each other, since they differ only in the size of the telson (\\"tail\\") and the position of the eyes. These two genera were originally deferred by a hypothetical twelfth segment in Paleomerus, but after the discovery and description of a fourth specimen of P. hamiltoni, it has been shown that this segment actually represents the tail of the animal. ==Description== Strabops thacheri. As the other strabopids, Paleomerus was a small-sized arthropod. The bigger species was P. hamiltoni at 9.3 centimetres (3.7 inches), while the smaller P. makowskii reached only 7.3 cm (2.9 in). Other Cambrian arthropods reached much greater lengths, such as the gigantic anomalocarid genus Anomalocaris that surpassed . Within Strabopida, the closely related Strabops thacheri exceeded the length of Paleomerus with 11 cm (4.3 in), while Parapaleomerus sinensis reached a total length of 9.2 cm (3.6 in). Like some other arthropod clades, the strabopids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. The arthropod body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the frontal prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and although they are unknown in strabopids (except for one undescribed specimen of Parapaleomerus), it is most likely they owned several pairs of them. Although the chemical composition of the strabopid exoskeleton is unknown, it was probably mineralized (with inorganic substances), sturdy and calcareous (containing calcium). The head of the strabopids was very short, the back was rounded and lacked trilobation (being divided in three lobes), the abdomen was composed by eleven segments and succeeded by a thick tail spine, the telson. In Paleomerus, the prosoma was parabolic (approximately U-shaped), and the opisthosoma can increase or decrease in width slightly or strongly. It was very flexible, possibly being able to flex laterally and roll up itself. The telson was trapezoidal, broad and tapering. Paleomerus may be the best model of a primitive arachnomorph. Paleomerus differs from Strabops only in the position of the eyes, which are farther from each other and closer to the margin than in Strabops, and the size of the telson, being shorter and broader than in the latter. ==History of research== Paleomerus has two species described; all other described strabopid genera are monotypic. The Norwegian paleontologist and geologist Leif St√∏rmer erected the genus based on two specimens (Ar. 47071, holotype, and Ar. 47073, the paratype) and tentatively classified it under the order Aglaspida in its own family, Paleomeriidae (also spelled Paleomeridae). Paleomerus is translated to \\"ancient part\\", with its name derived from the Ancient Greek words œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœåœÇ (palai√≥s, ancient) and ŒºŒ≠œÅŒøœÇ (m√©ros, part). The designated type species, P. hamiltoni, is named after Count Hugo Hamilton, who sent both fossils to the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm. In this species, the prosoma was short and had a parabolic shape with a somewhat concave posterior border. The posterolateral borders were rounded and lacked spines. The compound eyes appear as anterolateral reniform (bean-shaped) elevations in the surface of the prosoma. The opisthosoma increased slightly its width in the third and fourth segments, then decreased slightly until the seventh segment. All the tergites (the dorsal part of the segments) were similar, superimposing strongly on each other, with the half of the first segment being hidden under the prosoma. The rest of tergites were more slightly superimposed, indicating a great flexibility and even the ability to roll up itself. The telson was trapezoidal, but St√∏rmer mistook it as the twelfth segment of the body, suggesting a hypothetical lanceolate (lance-shaped) or fan-shaped telson. It is estimated that the size of this species was of 9.3 cm (3.7 in) judging by the length of the paratype. In 1971, the Swedish geologist and paleontologist Jan Bergstr√∂m described a new specimen of P. hamiltoni, RM Ar. 47170, found in the same place as the previous two. This new poorly preserved fossil contains molds of the first eleven segments, with a total corporal length estimated at 6.4 cm (2.5 in, being slightly larger than the holotype). Bergstr√∂m tentatively removed Strabopidae (at that time containing Strabops and Neostrabops) and Paleomeridae (only Paleomerus) from the order Aglaspidida based on the fact that the head tagma was too short to accommodate the six pairs of appendages then assumed to be present in aglaspidids. Instead, he classified them in an uncertain order in the Merostomoidea class together with the emeraldellids. Ironically, Bergstr√∂m speculated that the number of pairs of appendages present in the three genera could be fewer than seven, as well as including a possible antennal segment. This is currently observed as an overestimate. A study published by Derek Ernest Gilmor Briggs et al. in 1979 has shown that the aglaspidid Aglaspis spinifer had between four and five pairs of appendages, but not six, weakening Bergstr√∂m's argument. Restoration of P. makowskii, telson incomplete. In 1983, the Polish paleontologist Stanis≈Çaw Or≈Çowski described a second species of Paleomerus from the Ociesƒôki Sandstone Formation. Named Paleomerus makowskii, the specific name of this species honors the professor Henryk Makowski and is known by only one specimen with an almost completely preserved exoskeleton (IGPUW/Ag/1/1, housed at the Geological Faculty, Warsaw University). In this species, the exoskeleton was ovate, increasing its width from the prosoma to the fifth segment and rapidly decreasing posteriorly. It had a convex shape, with the second and third segments being the most convex. The prosoma was smooth, short, rounded on the front and with somewhat concave posterior borders. It was 1.7 cm (0.7 in) long and 4.2 cm (1.6 in) wide. The eyes were placed anterolaterally and rose slightly from the surface of the prosoma, with the left eye being the only one preserved. While segments 1-4 are complete, segments 5-10 are partially destroyed. The first ten segments are all alike, overlapping each other almost half the length in each segment. The eleventh was very different from the rest, being longer and less broad and with a straight anterior border. Both sides bent downwards and the posterior border was rounded. This segment measured approximately 1.1 cm (0.4 in) in length and 1.9 cm (0.7 in) in width. The telson was flat and trapezoidal, with the posterior edge being concave, although this may be due to poor preservation. It measured 1.3 cm (0.5 in) long and 2 cm (0.8 in) wide. Following St√∏rmer, Or≈Çowski interpreted the telson as the twelfth segment. The total length of P. makowskii is estimated at 7.3 cm (2.9 in), with a maximum width of 5 cm (2 in). Although the outline of the body and the proportions between the prosoma and opisthosoma suggest an assignment to Paleomerus, P. makowskii differs from P. hamiltoni in its great width and in the form of the eleventh segment and telson, as well as in the eyes, placed in elevations with vertical and straight lateral walls. In 1997, Bergstr√∂m and his partner Hou Xianguang, a Chinese paleontologist, completely removed Strabopidae (recognizing Paleomeridae as a junior synonym), as well as the family Lemoneitidae (containing Lemoneites), from the order Aglaspidida to erect a new order, Strabopida, this time suggesting a number of no more than two pairs of appendages. However, this new clade remained under the similarly- named Aglaspida subclass. A year later, the British paleontologists Jason Andrew Dunlop and Paul Antony Selden eliminated Strabopida from the suborder Aglaspidida and classified them as the sister taxa of the latter based on the lack of aglaspidid apomorphies (distinctive characteristics), such as the lack of genal spines (a spine placed in the posterolateral part of the prosoma). The authors who support this change have reinforced this argument by the trapezoidal form of the telson of Paleomerus and Strabops, in contrast to the long styliform (pen-shaped) telson of the aglaspidids. In 2004, the paleontologists O. Erik Tetlie and Rachel A. Moore described a fourth specimen of P. hamiltoni from the Mickwitzia Sandstone, PMO 201.957, housed at the Paleontologisk Museum, Oslo. Thanks to this new specimen, it was possible to confirm that Paleomerus did not possess twelve segments, but eleven, eliminating all the differences between Strabopidae and Paleomeridae (and therefore, making Paleomeridae redundant). It was also possible to notice an extra difference of Paleomerus and Strabops, the dimensions of the telson, being shorter and wider in the first than in the last one. Finally, Tetlie and Moore conclude that the phylogenetic position of the strabopids will be difficult to determine without further material that preserves the ventral morphology. Subsequent authors have preferred to omit the strabopids from their analyses due to the poor abundance and preservation of their fossils, although the most accepted classification at the moment is of arthropods closely related to the Aglaspidida order, but not within it. ==Classification== Restoration of Strabops thacheri. Some authors suspect they may represent the same animal. Paleomerus is classified in the order Strabopida, in the clade Arachnomorpha, along with Strabops, Parapaleomerus and potentially Khankaspis. It was described originally in 1956 as an intermediate form between xiphosurans (commonly known as horseshoe crabs) and eurypterids. It would not be until 1997 when the order Strabopida was described, but there is still doubt if the exclusion of them from Aglaspidida was really correct. The current status of the strabopids is of aglaspid-like arthropods of uncertain affinities. Paleomerus shares with the other strabopids a series of characteristics that distinguish them from all the other arthropods. These are an abdomen divided into eleven segments followed by a thick spine (the telson), a short head with sessile compound eyes and a rounded back. Like Strabops, Paleomerus possessed prominent dorsal eyes, however, there is no evidence of this in the fossils of Parapaleomerus. The great similarity that Strabops and Paleomerus share has cast doubt on many authors about whether both genera are really synonymous or not. St√∏rmer described Paleomerus as an intermediate form between Xiphosura and Eurypterida, only highlighting a unique feature different from Strabops, a twelfth segment. Nevertheless, a fourth specimen of the type species found in Sweden has shown that this extra segment actually represented the telson of the animal, making them virtually indistinguishable. Although this should convert both genera into synonyms, over time more differences have been highlighted, which are the position of the eyes (closer to each other and farther from the margin in Strabops than in Paleomerus) and the size of the telson (longer and narrower in Strabops than in Paleomerus), which keep them as separate but closely related genera. The cladogram below published by Jason A. Dunlop and Paul A. Selden (1998) is based on the major chelicerate groups (in bold, Aglaspida, Eurypterida and Xiphosurida, Scorpiones and other arachnid clades) and their outgroup taxa (used as a reference group). Strabops and Paleomerus are shown as the sister taxa of Aglaspida. Note that there are several outdated elements. For example, Lemoneites was remitted to the Glyptocystitida order of echinoderms in 2005. ==Paleoecology== Paleomerus fossils have been discovered in Lower Cambrian deposits of Sweden and Poland. The lanceolate body of Paleomerus could have facilitated rapid movements in the water, while the great flexibility of the abdomen would have allowed great agility and ability to spin in any direction. All this suggests that Paleomerus was an able swimmer who could even have rolled up itself on the sandy bottom of the sea as a method of protection. Due to the lack of knowledge of the ventral area, it is difficult to determine anything else about the paleoecology of Paleomerus. In the Mickwitzia Sandstone, where the specimens of P. hamiltoni were found, fossils of several other organisms have been found, such as the brachiopods Mickwitzia monilifera and M. pretiosa, the problematic indeterminate animal Torellella laevigata or the salterellid Volborthella tenuis. These and other fossils, as well as the occurrence of green mineral grains (probably glauconite), indicate that P. hamiltoni lived in a well ventilated marine environment. In addition, P. makowskii has been associated in the Ociesƒôki Sandstone Formation with the trilobites Holmia kjerulf, Kjerulfia orcina, Schmidtiellus panowi and Ellipsocephalus sanctacrucensis, alongside various indeterminate species of gasteropods, brachiopods and hyoliths. ==References== Category:Strabopida Category:Fossils of Poland Category:Fossils of Sweden Category:Fossil taxa described in 1956 Category:Controversial taxa ","title":"Paleomerus"},{"id":"56681991","text":"The list of shipwrecks in July 1833 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during July 1833. ==2 July== ==3 July== ==4 July== ==5 July== ==6 July== ==7 July== ==10 July== ==11 July== ==12 July== ==13 July== ==18 July== ==19 July== ==20 July== ==21 July== ==22 July== ==25 July== ==28 July== ==29 July== ==31 July== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1833-07 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in July 1833"},{"id":"56681999","text":"B√©la Nyitrai was a male Hungarian international table tennis player.

The unusual object has the largest heliocentric aphelion of any known minor planet, even larger than that of ; it is calculated to reach several thousand AU (Earth-Sun) distances at the farthest extent of its orbit. == Orbit and classification == orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.5‚Äì6,082 AU once every 167,878 years (semi-major axis of 3043 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.9985 and an inclination of 56¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As it has an eccentricity higher than 0.50, the distant object is labelled an (other) unusual object by the Minor Planet Center. The Johnston's Archive groups it to the damocloids, due to its extreme orbital elements and a TJupiter of less than 2, while in JPL's Small Body Database, it is a trans- Neptunian object with a semi-major axis larger than that of Neptune. { class= style=\\"text-align: right; font-size: 11px; float: left; margin-right: 1.2em;\\" - bgcolor=#333 style=\\"color: white; font-size: smaller;\\"  colspan=4 style=\\"text-align: center;\\" Orbital evolution ‚Äî Barycentric elements - !

While its orbit extends to the inner Oort cloud, it may not be a member of it, as it approaches very near to Saturn, implying Saturn has either captured a past Oort Cloud object onto this orbit, or it was a centaur ejected by Saturn from a much smaller orbit. However, it would be impossible to project its orbit far enough into the past to determine which scenario is true. Like most objects on an extremely distant orbit around the Sun, 's barycentric orbit is very different from its heliocentric orbit, the latter being based only on the current position of the Solar System barycenter, and the former is based on the long-term movement of the barycenter. While the heliocentric aphelion is 7,000‚Äì9,000 AU, depending on the calculation, the current barycentric aphelion (as of 2018) is only 1,700 AU. Before its perihelion in 2016 AD (after that of ~30500 BC), it reached 2,000 AU from the sun around ~14300 BC. == Physical characteristics == Very little is known for certain about the body's physical characteristics. The Johnston's Archive assumes a generic distant-object albedo of 0.09 and calculates a diameter of 8 kilometers.

Major applications arise in manufacturing systems, computer systems, communication systems, logistics and transportation, machine learning, etc. ==Introduction== The objective of the stochastic scheduling problems can be regular objectives such as minimizing the total flowtime, the makespan, or the total tardiness cost of missing the due dates; or can be irregular objectives such as minimizing both earliness and tardiness costs of completing the jobs, or the total cost of scheduling tasks under likely arrival of a disastrous event such as a severe typhoon. The performance of such systems, as evaluated by a regular performance measure or an irregular performance measure, can be significantly affected by the scheduling policy adopted to prioritize over time the access of jobs to resources. The goal of stochastic scheduling is to identify scheduling policies that can optimize the objective. Stochastic scheduling problems can be classified into three broad types: problems concerning the scheduling of a batch of stochastic jobs, multi-armed bandit problems, and problems concerning the scheduling of queueing systems . These three types are usually under the assumption that complete information is available in the sense that the probability distributions of the random variables involved are known in advance. When such distributions are not fully specified and there are multiple competing distributions to model the random variables of interest, the problem is referred to as incomplete information. The Bayesian method has been applied to treat stochastic scheduling problems with incomplete information. ==Scheduling of a batch of stochastic jobs== In this class of models, a fixed batch of n jobs with random process times, whose distributions are known, have to be completed by a set of m machines to optimize a given performance objective. The simplest model in this class is the problem of sequencing a set of n jobs on a single machine to minimize the expected weighted flowtime. Job processing times are independent random variables with a general distribution G_i(\\\\cdot) with mean p_i for job i. Admissible policies must be nonanticipative (scheduling decisions are based on the system's history up to and including the present time) and nonpreemptive (processing of a job must proceed uninterruptedly to completion once started). Let w_i\\\\ge 0 denote the cost rate incurred per unit time in the system for job i, and let \\\\tilde{C}_i denote its random completion time. Let \\\\Pi denote the class of all admissible policies, and let E_{\\\\pi}[\\\\cdot] denote expectation under policy \\\\pi\\\\in \\\\Pi. The problem can be stated as \\\\min_{\\\\pi\\\\in \\\\Pi} w_1E_{\\\\pi}[\\\\tilde{C}_1]+\\\\cdots+w_nE_{\\\\pi}[\\\\tilde{C}_n]. The optimal solution in the special deterministic case is given by the Shortest Weighted Processing Time rule of Smith: sequence jobs in nonincreasing order of the priority index w_ip_i. The natural extension of Smith's rule is also optimal to the above stochastic model. In general, the rule that assigns higher priority to jobs with shorter expected processing time is optimal for the flowtime objective under the following assumptions: when all the job processing time distributions are exponential; when all the jobs have a common general processing time distribution with a nondecreasing hazard rate function; and when job processing time distributions are stochastically ordered. ==Multi- armed bandit problems== Multi-armed bandit models form a particular type of optimal resource allocation (usually working with time assignment), in which a number of machines or processors are to be allocated to serve a set of competing projects (termed as arms). In the typical framework, the system consists of a single machine and a set of stochastically independent projects, which will contribute random rewards continuously or at certain discrete time points, when they are served. The objective is to maximize the expected total discounted rewards over all dynamically revisable policies. The first version of multi-bandit problems was formulated in the area of sequential designs by Robbins (1952). Since then, there had not been any essential progress in two decades, until Gittins and his collaborators made celebrated research achievements in Gittins (1979), Gittins and Jones (1974), Gittins and Glazebrook (1977), and Whittle (1980) under the Markov and semi-Markov settings. In this early model, each arm is modeled by a Markov or semi-Markov process in which the time points of making state transitions are decision epochs. The machine can at each epoch pick an arm to serve with a reward represented as a function of the current state of the arm being processed, and the solution is characterized by allocation indices assigned to each state that depends only on the states of the arms. These indices are therefore known as Gittins indices and the optimal policies are usually called Gittins index policies, due to his reputable contributions. Soon after the seminal paper of Gittins, the extension to branching bandit problem to model stochastic arrivals (also known as the open bandit or arm acquiring bandit problem) was investigated by Whittle (1981). Other extensions include the models of restless bandit, formulated by Whittle (1988), in which each arm evolves restlessly according to two different mechanisms (idle fashion and busy fashion), and the models with switching costs/delays by Van Oyen et al. (1992), who showed that no index policy is optimal when switching between arms incurs costs/delays. ==Scheduling of queueing systems== Models in this class are concerned with the problems of designing optimal service disciplines in queueing systems, where the jobs to be completed arrive at random epochs over time, instead of being available at the start. The main class of models in this setting is that of multiclass queueing networks (MQNs), widely applied as versatile models of computer communications and manufacturing systems. The simplest types of MQNs involve scheduling a number of job classes in a single server. Similarly as in the two model categories discussed previously, simple priority-index rules have been shown to be optimal for a variety of such models. More general MQN models involve features such as changeover times for changing service from one job class to another (Levy and Sidi, 1990), or multiple processing stations, which provide service to corresponding nonoverlapping subsets of job classes. Due to the intractability of such models, researchers have aimed to design relatively simple heuristic policies which achieve a performance close to optimal. ==Stochastic scheduling with incomplete information == The majority of studies on stochastic scheduling models have largely been established based on the assumption of complete information, in the sense that the probability distributions of the random variables involved, such as the processing times and the machine up/downtimes, are completely specified a priori. However, there are circumstances where the information is only partially available. Examples of scheduling with incomplete information can be found in environmental clean-up, project management, petroleum exploration, sensor scheduling in mobile robots, and cycle time modeling, among many others. As a result of incomplete information, there may be multiple competing distributions to model the random variables of interest. An effective approach is developed by Cai et al. (2009), to tackle this problem, based on Bayesian information update. It identifies each competing distribution by a realization of a random variable, say \\\\Theta. Initially, \\\\Theta has a prior distribution based on historical information or assumption (which may be non-informative if no historical information is available). Information on \\\\Theta may be updated after realizations of the random variables are observed. A key concern in decision making is how to utilize the updated information to refine and enhance the decisions. When the scheduling policy is static in the sense that it does not change over time, optimal sequences are identified to minimize the expected discounted reward and stochastically minimize the number of tardy jobs under a common exponential due date. When the scheduling policy is dynamic in the sense that it can make adjustments during the process based on up-to-date information, posterior Gittins index is developed to find the optimal policy that minimizes the expected discounted reward in the class of dynamic policies. == References == Category:Scheduling (computing) ","title":"Stochastic scheduling"},{"id":"56682159","text":"Saw Sein Tun (; born 9 December 1962) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as a House of Nationalities member of parliament for Kayah State ‚Ññ 4 constituency.

There has been a church on the site since at least 1268 with the present structure mostly dating to the 13th and 15th-centuries.The Pilgrim's Guide to Devon's Churches, Cloister Books (2008) pg 99 The church comes under the Diocese of Exeter and has been a Grade II* listed building since 1965.Church of St Peter, Fremington on the English Heritage Listed Building database ==History and design== The baptismal font dates to 1867 It is known that there has been a church on the site since at least 1268 when the first chaplain, Roger, was appointed, and there is substantial evidence of Norman construction following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Built of roughly coursed stone rubble with ashlar dressings, the porch and the bell tower are the oldest parts of the churchNikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books ((1952) pg 88 with their remains of Norman arches dating to the 12th and 13th-centuries. Recessed into the outside wall to the right of the church door is a holy water font or stoup which is pre- Reformation and which would have been used for making the sign of the cross before entering the church. The square tower may originally have had a lead- covered spire, removed for unknown reasons. Between the 13th and 15th- centuries the church was enlarged and embellished so that it now comprises two aisles with two parallel roofs, one smaller than the other and decorated with Perpendicular-style pillars and arches.Ruth Winstone, Guide to St Peter's Parish Church, Fremington (Privately published) (2017) pg 2E.V. Michelmore, Guide to St Peter's Church, Fremington (Privately published in 1944; reprinted in 2000) View down the nave towards the chancel In 1813 the ancient pillars and a \\"rich and elegant\\" Gothic rood screen were removed and replaced by far less elegant columns. At this time a singing gallery was added at the back of the church in order to accommodate a string band while the window frames with their fine tracery were also removed. However, in 1866 the architect Sir Gilbert Scott was working nearby in Barnstaple on St Peter's church and his services were secured from 1867 to 1868 at St Peter's in Fremington. Scott reversed the earlier \\"improvements\\" with the singing gallery being removed and eight new columns being reintroduced decorated with vines, fruit and faces (some grotesque) connected along the length of the church with Gothic-style arches. New arched stone window frames were inserted and some of the old tracey having been found was placed back in its original position. The church was reopened for worship in 1867.Winstone, pg 3 The lychgate was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (c1867) Scott also designed the lychgate which presumably replaced an earlier structure; he incorporated the large rectangular stone traditionally used for resting coffins on into his design. The gates were replaced in the early 21st-century following Scott's original design. The heavily restored 15th-century pulpit The wine-glass stone pulpit was unearthed during restoration in the 1860s buried in a mutilated condition beneath the church floor. It is believed to be 15th-century and is decorated with beautifully carved figures of Jesus and the Four Evangelists; it retains some of its original colour but was heavily restored during the 19th-century. The baptismal font dates to 1867 and its fine carvings around the bowl depict Noah's Ark and the dove sent out to find land. Also around the bowl are carved the words of Jesus, \\"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God\\". The church organ with its hand- cranked pianolo roll was originally in a private home but was donated to the church where it was installed in 1907. It has a range of fifty-six notes and was rebuilt in 2002. There is a fragment of a medieval wall painting on the south wall which shows two angels and two towers of the Holy City.Winstone, pg 4 The reredos is of alabaster and Caen stone with the symbols Alpha and Omega (the first and last) carved on either side of the marble cross. The altar table is Elizabethan. Above the main door is a large painted panel depicting the Royal Coat of Arms of Queen Anne which was placed here sometime between 1707 and her death in 1714, as the insignia shown are those of the monarch after the Acts of Union of 1707.Winstone, pg 5 The stained glass is 19th and 20th-century and variously depicts Jesus blessing the Little Children; the Pharisee and the Tax Collector; the Good Shepherd; the Raising of Jairus' Daughter; Jesus as a Fisher of Men; the Resurrection, and the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The bell tower contains a peal of six bells with two medieval bells no longer in use and stored in the bell chamber. The wall monuments and tablets are to Susanna Davie, (d.1694), with its oval medallion swathed with drapery, a scallop and skull to the base and amorini to each side. There is an undated memorial to Richard Slowly with its broken pediment and central achievement. A slate tablet is dedicated to George Bragg of Loveacot (d.1629). There are five diamond-shaped hatchments with painted arms and a large 18th- century wall monument to the Harding family. ==References== ==External links== *Website of St Peter's Church, Fremington *St Peter's Church, Fremington on Find a Grave Category:Barnstaple Category:Buildings and structures in Barnstaple Fremington Fremington ","title":"Church of St Peter, Fremington"},{"id":"56682335","text":"The list of shipwrecks in September 1833 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during September 1833. ==1 September== ==2 September== ==3 September== ==4 September== ==5 September== ==6 September== ==7 September== ==8 September== ==10 September== ==11 September== ==12 September== ==14 September== ==15 September== ==16 September== ==19 September== ==21 September== ==22 September== ==23 September== ==24 September== ==25 September== ==27 September== ==28 September== ==29 September== ==30 September== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1833-09 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in September 1833"},{"id":"56682336","text":"Patrick Gudauskas (born November 20, 1985 in La Jolla) is an American/Lithuanian professional surfer.

It received widespread media coverage and affected Italian politics as it occurred during the political campaign for the 2018 Italian general election. ==Events== On 3 February 2018, in the city of Macerata, Marche, 28-year-old local Luca Traini, driving a black Alfa Romeo 147 and armed with a 9mm Glock 17 Gen3 semi-automatic pistol, seriously wounded, in a drive-by shooting, six African migrants. Traini also targeted the local headquarters of the ruling Italian Democratic Party. After the attack, Traini reportedly had an Italian flag draped on his shoulders and raised his arm in a Fascist salute. Traini said the attack was revenge for the murder of Pamela Mastropietro, an 18-year-old local girl whose dismembered body had been found a few days earlier, stuffed into two suitcases and dumped in the countryside. For this, a 29-year-old Nigerian national and failed asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, had been arrested and charged. Oseghale had been denied asylum a year previously, but remained in Italy. ==Aftermath== Traini was a member and former local candidate of Lega Nord, and many political commentators, intellectuals and politicians harshly criticized the League's leader Matteo Salvini, accusing him of having spread hate and racism in the country. Particularly, the notable anti-mafia writer Roberto Saviano labeled Salvini as the moral instigator of the attack. Salvini responded to critics by accusing the center-left government of responsibility for Mastropietro's death for allowing migrants to stay in the country and having \\"blood on their hands\\", asserting the blame lies with those who \\"fill us with illegal immigrants\\". Then Italian Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti harshly condemned the attack, saying that no political party must \\"ride the hate\\". During the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, Traini's name was written on one of weapon magazines of the perpetrator, Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, alongside other far-right mass murderers and killers in addition to historical figures and battles. Tarrant also named Traini as among the shooters and killers that he supported because they \\"take a stand against ethnic and cultural genocide\\". Traini dissociated himself from the event, declaring himself to be regretful about Macerata's facts. The \\"Prosecutor's Office of Macerata\\" formulated against Traini the accusation of massacre aggravated by the purpose of racism, in addition to other crimes, including the abusive port of firearms. On 3 October 2018 Traini was sentenced to 12 years of detention in prison with a summary judgment. ==References== Category:2018 crimes in Italy Category:21st century in Marche Category:Crime in Marche Category:February 2018 crimes in Europe Category:February 2018 events in Italy Shooting Category:Neo-fascist attacks in Italy Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2018 Category:Terrorist incidents in Italy in the 2010s Category:2018 mass shootings in Europe Category:White nationalist terrorism ","title":"Macerata shooting"},{"id":"56682387","text":"Major George Gavin (1810 ‚Äì 23 October 1880) was an Irish Independent Irish Party and Liberal politician.

Slosarczykovia is placed in the family Brachioteuthidae. Slosarczykovia circumantarctica is a relatively large species of squid attaining a mantle length of 170 mm, the mantle having a long and slender form with rhomboid shaped fins placed posteriorly. accessed Feb 25 2018. The suckers on the arms are very variable some completely lacking in teeth, others with few teeth and yet others with many teeth. The tentacles have the largest suckers running from the proximal manus and these are about three quarters in diameter of largest sucker from proximal dactylus. The suckers on the tentacular club are weakly differentiated. There is no carpal locking mechanism and there are 13 small carpal suckers which form a row along the dorsal margin of the manus. In squid with a mantle length of greater than 60mm the mantle, fins, head and arms are covered in a fibrous, net like covering of the integument. There is no hectocotylus on the males. Slosarczykovia circumantarctica was described from a type specimen collected off Wilkes Land, Antarctica and it is thought to have a distribution throughout the seas around Antarctica. It is one of the most common species of squid in Antarctic waters but little is known of the biology of this pelagic species. It is not currently fished for. The generic name Slosarczykovia honours was derived from the surname of the late Dr Wieslaw Sl√≥sarczyk, who was responsible for collecting almost all the specimens used to describe the species while the specific name circumantarctica refers to the circumpolar distribution of the species in the Southern Ocean. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 2001 Category:Cephalopod genera Category:Monotypic mollusc genera ","title":"Slosarczykovia"},{"id":"56682403","text":"James Kenneth 'Ken' Hyde was a male English international table tennis player. ==Table tennis career== He won two bronze medals at the 1939 World Table Tennis Championships in the men's doubles with Hyman Lurie and in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Ernest Bubley, Hyman Lurie, Ken Stanley and Arthur Wilmott.

The game was self-published by its developer, Peter Hewitt, off his website and at a stall in Townville's \\"Cotter's Markets\\". == Development == Peter Hewitt based the game on a trip he had through a national park, and used the photos he took there as the backdrop of the title. The game, developed solely by Hewitt, took around a year to complete. The title is an acronym. The game was playtested by a young puzzle lover named Penny, and were crafted to allow novices to have a go while challenging long-time puzzlers. Hewitt's favourite puzzle is The Venus Jigsaw. Some of his puzzles, such as the three turtle puzzles, don't require prior knowledge and can be completed with by press buttons and experimenting. Hewitt expected some of the more challenging puzzles to last more than one play session. He found the cave system one of the highlights to develop. On March 15, 2000, Hewitt developed the concept of the Xiama \\"books\\" in order to get away from the usual games saving mechanism. The Xiama website went live on March 19. On April 24, Bill Basham gave permission for the use of his midi version of Waltzing Matilda. The post-its idea was implemented on May 18, as Hewitt had long wanted to add personal touches to the game. The puzzles were completed on June 1. On June 3, he negotiated a deal with Listening Earth to use their bird calls and dingo howls. On June 4, Bill Basham agreed to his use of \\"The Rejection\\" in the project. The game uses the ClickTeam Installation program. The game had no marketing efforts either for or against women. Hewitt's \\"personalised and artisinal\\" web presence invited players ton open and direct dialogue, with items such as a diary detailing the game's development. Hewitt followed up this game with the puzzle adventures Magnetic and Magicama. Xiama Revisited was made in 2007 using BlitzBasic 2D, Paintshop Pro 9, Bryce 5, and CoolEdit 2000. It was play tested by Doug Bradley, and dedicated in the memory of Penny Cadwell. At the beginning of 2017 in January, both versions became free. == Plot and gameplay == The in-game book allows players to see their progress throughout the game. Completed puzzles appear on the page while unfinished puzzles are left blank. The player score is shown at the bottom. The puzzles vary in design and theme. The game is set in the North Queensland rainforest Alligator Creek Falls, located at Bowling Green Bay National Park .The player arrives at the park to meet up with their friend Peter for a trek, only to receive a note saying he's gone on ahead. The player proceeds to wander on alone, discovering a rich landscape along the way. Xiama is a first person game primarily in 2D. The player progresses through a series of static screens, and interacts with hotspots to access puzzles. Like its follow-up Magnetic, Xiama blends 3D graphics with slideshow-styled photo backdrops. There are 24 puzzles placed within the 100 environments. Completing puzzles will unlock further areas and puzzles, and progressing through the game increases the player's score. The last puzzle is only unlocked after the player completes the other 23. The puzzles are superimposed onto photos of the national park. When the player completes a puzzle, a sticky note is added to their journal which contains some of the player's thoughts and reflections. Puzzles a re-scrambled when the player leaves the area, to enable the revisiting of old puzzles The soundscape consists of bird calls, campfire cracking, stream water, and animal noises; meanwhile, two puzzles revolve around the traditional folk song Waltzing Matilda. The game is completable within a 24-hour period. == Critical reception == MrBillsAdventureland felt the game reminded them of Jewels of the Oracle, due to its exotic and fascinating setting, and its challenging and addictive gameplay. The site felt, however, that its follow-up, Magnetic, would have a richer mix of game types and wished both these titles had junior versions for younger players. Quandary noted the game was not an adventure in the traditional sense, due to lacking inventory, item collection, and an unfolding story. Pibweb noted that the game was not 100% accurate, due to it including a cave scene, when Alligator Creek doesn't have a cave system. Just Adventure recommended the game to lovers of puzzles, photography, and nature. GameZone appreciated the fact that the game was not run of the mill. Game Vortex noted that the game's puzzles vary wildly in difficulty. Computer Games Online deemed it a \\"fiendishly cerebral offering\\", and felt that the in-game reward for completing the game came off as a \\"cruel joke\\". Academic Stephen Granade thought the game's largest deficiencies were in its interface and lack of documentation, and described it as playing like Myst, only more boring. Adventure Gamers thought the game offered a better experience when played with family and friends. Thanks to the game, GameBoomers looked forward to future projects from Mulawa Dreaming. Mystery Manor felt the game was challenging, particular navigating around the park. BonusWeb forgave the amateurish screens as having a similar charm to the 1995 Czech point-and-click adventure game Ramonovo Kouzlo by Vochozka Trading.

He was Bagdi by caste, popularly known as Bishe Dakaat. ==Revolt== The first phase of revolts in Eastern British India started in the early part of the nineteenth century. Biswanath Sardar led the rebellion in Jessore, Nadia and 24 Parganas. The indigo planters forced the peasants to plant indigo instead of food crops. They provided loans, called dadon, at a very high interest. Subsequently the farmer remained in debt for his whole life before passing it to his successors. The price paid by the planters was meager, only 2.5% of the market price. Sardar organized the Peasant movement, made first notable resistance against the atrocities of Nil Kar (Indigo planters) and started looting the estate of planters one by one. He did not even spare the residence and factory of Indigo planters. First he attacked in Santipur Nilkuthi, afterwards robbed numbers of Kuthis in Khalboalia, Shikarpore, Banshberia, Nischintapur villages. At midnight on 27 September 1808 the peasant rebels surrounded the estate of Samuel Faddy, a planter. Sardar set fire and destroyed the estate but freed Faddy. This incident terrorized all the indigo planters and police sought to arrest Sardar. ==Death== A few months after the attack on Faddy's residence, Police head Mr. Eliot and Mr. Blaquiere, the District Magistrate of Nadia arrested Sardar. He was hanged in Assannagar village after a trial. The police declared him an outlaw but he had a Robin Hood like heroic image to the poor farmers. Sardar was known as Babu Biswanath as well as the first martyr of Indigo revolt in India. == Popular culture == There are numerous tales of his actions.

In September 2018, Rajaonarimampianina stepped down to run for reelection, allowing a caretaker government to administer the vote, in accordance with the constitution. There were a record 36 candidates in the race (surpassing the previous record of 33), including four of the five most recent presidents. However, only five candidates were women, seen by some of illustrating the historic patriarchal dominance of Malagasy politics and culture. ==Campaign== Despite the majority of Malagasy people living in poverty, the elections are expected to be one of the most expensive per capita in 2018. The top three candidates; Hery Rajaonarimampianina, Andry Rajoelina, and Marc Ravalomanana are at a significant financial advantage over the other contenders, with candidate Ny Rado Rafalimanana complaining that due to financial constraints it was impossible for any other candidate to compete with the top three, as there are no campaign finance limits. Some election observers believe that the winner of the election will have more to do with that candidate's financial power and influence than their political positions. The lavish spending on the election has also been criticized due to the large amount of poverty in the country, with many believing the money could be better spent elsewhere.

He is remembered as the man who twice saved the Great Seal of the State of Georgia. ==Early life== Barnett was born in Columbia County, Georgia in 1801 to William Barnett and Ann Crawford Barnett. His father died while Barnett was still quite young, and his widowed mother moved the family to Lexington in Oglethorpe County where he received his education at the Lexington Academy. Barnett married Margaret J. Morton of Clarke County and the couple established a home in Watkinsville, which was the county seat at that time. Barnett engaged in planting and merchandising, and in 1832 he was elected Surveyor, and assisted in surveying the Cherokee Purchase in the area of present day Roswell, Georgia in preparation for the sixth state administrated land lottery. It was during this time that he was also elected to the position of major in the Georgia Militia. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of colonel, and in that capacity assisted in the Cherokee Removal from Georgia. Col. Barnett's first wife died in 1840, and he remarried shortly thereafter to Mary Ann Cooper. ==Political career== ===Georgia House of Representatives=== In 1836 Col. Barnett was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. Of the legislative initiatives which he sponsored or supported, during this period, the most notable was one which authorized construction of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. That government-owned railroad was established on December 21, 1836. The city of Atlanta was founded as the end of the W&A;, with the terminus marked with the Atlanta Zero Mile Post. The line is still owned by the State of Georgia from Atlanta to CT Tower in Chattanooga. After two terms in the House, Barnett declined to run for re-election, after the illness and death of his first wife in 1840. ===Secretary of State=== In 1843, Barnett was elected (by the Georgia State Senate) to the position of Georgia Secretary of State, a position he held for three terms until 1849. He was subsequently elected to another, single, term in 1851. He was again elected to the position for the period 1861-1868, but was removed by the Military Governor at the onset of the Reconstruction era. It is said that Barnett twice saved the Great Seal of the State of Georgia. The first time was when Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman were about to capture the State Capitol at Milledgeville. Barnett took the seal, and numerous official documents and Acts, and with the assistance of his wife Mary, buried them at his farm. After Sherman's troops marched on, Barnett returned the seal and the documents to the state. In 1866 Barnett again removed the Great Seal from the capitol. General Ruger, who was at that time acting as the Military Governor of Georgia, requested that Barnett affix the seal to an executive act, which Colonel Barnett could not approve. He refused to sanction the papers with the imprint of the seal and as a consequence was removed by General Ruger. Colonel Barnett then took the seal with him to prevent it from falling into the hands of what was considered an illegitimate Carpetbagger government which occupied the state: so that it was never affixed to any of the documents of misrule which followed under the carpetbag government. Since the seal was required, to certify official acts of the state government, the Reconstruction government fabricated a replacement. That replacement was identical in all respects except one. The soldier depicted on the replacement seal held his sword in the wrong hand. The period of the Reconstruction government in Georgia is thus referred to as the \\"Period of the False Seal\\". The Great Seal and documents were buried on Barnett's farm, and remained hidden there until 1868, when a new state constitution was enacted and a new government installed. After democrats regained control of state government, Barnett was again elected Secretary of State in 1873. Upon his return to office, both houses of the Legislature voted to present him with a replica of the Executive Seal, which replica is now in Savannah, Georgia, the property of the Georgia Historical Society. Barnett continued to serve as Secretary of State until his death on 2 February 1890. Toward the end of his more than 30 years of service as secretary of state under numerous administrations and into his late 80s, he was said to wear a row of three pairs of glasses. A portrait of Barnett hangs in the office of the Georgia Secretary of State to this day. ==Death and legacy== In his youth, Nathan Crawford Barnett was reported to be tall and thin, at 6'6\\" in height. Only three of Nathan and Mary Barnett's eight children survived into adulthood. Barnett was remembered as a life-long Methodist. The Georgia Capitol (relocated to Atlanta in 1868) was closed February 4, 1890, the day of Colonel Barnett's funeral, held at Milledgeville. The Central Railroad tendered free use of its cars for Colonel Barnett's family and members of the funeral party. Mary A. Barnett died in Atlanta on January 11, 1902, at the age of 82. She was buried in Milledgeville. ==References== ==External links== * Image of Georgia historical marker - Hiding Place of the Great Seal * * List of Georgia's Secretaries of State Category:1801 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Secretaries of State of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:19th-century American politicians Category:American Methodists Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Nathan Crawford Barnett"},{"id":"56683222","text":"Evi Lanig (born 24 October 1933) is a German alpine skier.

One of her grandmothers was Jewish. == Early life == Nienau was born in Dortmund as the only child of Bernhard Nienau, a physician (June 23, 1887 - February 29, 1926). Her father died shortly before she was born. Her mother Karoline, n√©e Helwig, a nurse (March 15, 1892 - July 26, 1962), moved to Munich and bought a house there, around 1928. Bernile's grandmother Ida Voit, a Roman Catholic teacher of Jewish descent, widow or divorcee of Karoline Helwig, n√©e Morgenstern (18 July 1867 - 29 December 1942) also lived with them. === Interaction with Hitler === Probably at the instigation of her mother, Bernile, whose birthday was, like Hitler's, 20 April, pressed in the spring of 1933 in the forefront of the stream of visitors on Obersalzberg to grab Hitler's attention. From that contact she developed a \\"friendship\\" that lasted until 1938. In the Federal Archives in Berlin there are 17 letters which the girl wrote, probably with the help of her mother, between 18 January 1935 and 12 November 1939, to Hitler and his chief aide Wilhelm Br√ºckner. An extract: > Munich, September 27, 36. Dear Uncle Br√ºckner! Today I have a lot to tell > you. During the holidays we were on the Obersalzberg and I was twice allowed > to dear Uncle Hitler! Unfortunately, you have never been up. [...] I am > already working on the Christmas work. [...] Uncle Hitler I knit some socks > again because I asked him if they fit him last year. He said yes! This year > I can knit with finer wool, mom only helps me with the heel. They are going > to be very warm, and where he always travels so much, his feet will not feel > cold. [...] Mommy also sends you greetings and many greetings and kisses > from your Bernile! The fact that Bernile's grandmother and mother were Jewish was already known to Hitler in 1933. On 19 April 1938, Hitler's adjutant Fritz Wiedemann described Hitler's disregard for her Jewish ancestry to subordinate party offices as \\"a purely human attitude toward the child\\". However, when Martin Bormann got wind of the lack of \\"German-bloodiness\\", the girl and her mother were forbidden to appear in Berghof. Hitler learned about it because his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann complained that Bormann had forbidden him to continue to publish photos showing the F√ºhrer as \\"his child\\". In his book Hitler as I Saw Him\\", Hoffmann writes that Hitler said about Bormann: \\"There are people who have a true talent to spoil my every joy.\\"Heinrich Hoffmann: Hitler wie ich ihn sah. Aufzeichnungen seines Leibfotografen. Herbig, M√ºnchen und Berlin 1974, , S. 166. While Hoffmann's illustrated book Youth around Hitler which included the photographs of Hitler with Bernile continued to sell, around May 1938 the mother was officially asked to stop any contacts with party leaders. Bernile, who learned the profession of a technical draftsman, died on 5 October 1943 at 17 in Schwabing Hospital of spinal poliomyelitis. Her grave is located on the Munich West Cemetery.Bayern - Land und Leute. Lieber guter Onkel Hitler. br.de, 27. Oktober 2013Volker Dahm, Albert A.

In 2010 she was selected for the Advanced Course in Visual Art at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Como in Italy under visiting professor Hans Haacke. Between 2012 and 2013 Husni-Bey was a fellow researcher for the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. == Career == Adelita Husni-Bey's work focuses on complex questions about gender, race and class using collectivist and informal pedagogical models within the framework of urban studies. Her practice involves the analysis and counter- representation of the hegemonic ideology in Western society. Practicing as both an artist and a pedagogue she activates creative processes, such as role- playing, group undertakings and workshops with students, athletes, lawyers, activists and architects. As part of her methodology, she sets up situations and experiments where her collaborators understand their own relationship to the social and economic power of our present times. In the film Postcards from the Desert Island (2011) the artist documents a three week workshop with children from an experimental, self-run elementary public school in Paris, √âcole Vitruve. The school was created in 1962 with the aim of experimenting with educational models based on co-operation and non-competitiveness. To test the potentiality of radical education, Husni-Bey, inspired by the novel Lord of the Flies (1963) by William Golding, asked a group of children aged between seven and ten years, to imagine their school's hall as a desert island and to relate themselves to the new territory. The film documents how the group of children organize and how they relate to problems and imagine a life without institutions or control, and where to draw the distinction between public and private. The work White Paper (2014 - ongoing) consists of an ongoing research into the relationship between the notion of property, legislation, and the right to housing under capitalism. It focuses on three countries: Egypt, The Netherlands and Spain. The first chapter White Paper: The Land (2014) was presented in Cairo at Beirut (art space). It consists of a video-installation focused on the land rights of people affected by the mega-urban development Cairo 2050, a government-backed and privately funded metropolitan development plan of massive proportions, which threatens the livelihood of many informal settlements such as the neighbourhood of Gezirat al-Qursaya and Ramlet Boulaq. The second chapter White Paper: The Law (2015) was supported by Casco (Utrecht) and it resulted in a legal document, the Convention on the Use of Space. The document was written through a series of public drafting meetings across the Netherlands in collaboration with squatters, lawyers, housing rights activists, tenants associations and the general public. For the last chapter of the project White Paper: The Imaginery (2016) the Convention travelled to Spain, to M√≥stoles neighbourhood in Madrid and it was hosted by CA2M. The project was carried on in various independent spaces and squatted social centres, where a number of public meetings were held to draw up the Spanish version of the text. The project is documented by a book, White Paper On Land, law And The Imaginary edited by Antonia Alampi, Binna Choi, Jens Maier-Rothe, Pablo Mart√≠nez. The Reading / La Seduta, was presented at the Italian Pavilion, curated by Cecilia Alemani, at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The artist organized a workshop in Mannahatta (Lenape territory, known as Manhattan, New York) with a group of youngsters which consisted of meetings, discussions and theatre exercises inspired by the Theater of the Oppressed. The activities were focused on participants' connection to the environment and to the exploitation of the earth in relation to complex topics such as technology, use, value, threat and vulnerability. The workshops resulted in a film where the artist designed a tarot deck which was used as a performative device and an excuse as well for participants to talk about their own spiritual, colonial, and technological relationships to the earth and land. The installation was accompanied by a series of sculptures representing luminescent silicone hands. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * 2019 Adelita Husni Bey: Chiron, New Museum, New York *2017 Adelita Husni Bey - Four Films curated by Lucia Pietroiusti for Serpentine Cinema, Peckhamplex, London * 2017 Il Mondo Magico, curated by Cecilia Alemani, national representation, Italian Pavilion, 57th Venice Biennale * 2017 2265, Miller Contemporary, New York * 2017 Libro blanco: la tierra, la ley y el imaginario, curated by Pablo Mart√≠nez, CA2M, Madrid * 2016 A Wave in the Well, curated by Nora Raizan, Sursock Museum, Beirut The Classroom, Ex-Montessori school, Milan * 2015 Movement Break, Kadist Art Foundation, San Francisco * 2015 White Paper Chapter II, Casco, (Office for Design Art and Theory) Utrecht * 2014 Il Principe, la Classe e lo Stato, Laveronica arte contemporanea, Modica, Sicily Agency ‚Äì giochi di potere, NCTM e l‚Äôarte, Studio Legale NCTM, Milano * 2014 White Paper: The Land (chapter I), Beirut, Cairo, Egypt * 2014 Opening, solo stand at ARCO artfair, Madrid * 2013 Present Future, solo stand at Artissima, Artfair, Turin * 2012 Playing Truant curated by Robert Leckie, Gasworks, London. * 2012 Clays Lane Live Archive curated by Shama Khanna, Supplement Gallery, London. * 2011 La Montagna Verde.

He married Gladys Harmer in 1917 and had a family including a son called Sydney 'Clare' Orton in 1918. When oval circuit greyhound racing arrived in Britain in 1926, he swapped his interest in coursing to become Clerk of the Scales and then a trainer during the early years at Wimbledon Stadium. The family lived in the Wimbledon trainers complex known as Burhill Kennels in Hersham, Walton-on-Thames. In December 1929 he was propelled to national fame when he took charge of Mick the Miller and won the 1930 English Greyhound Derby. During the 1930s he won a significant number of classic races and was one of the leading trainers in the country. He earned the nickname 'The Wizard of Burhill'. He handled the famous greyhounds including Ballynennan Moon, Brilliant Bob, Ballyhennessy Sandhills, Quare Times, Mondays News and Burhill Moon before retiring in 1959.

He was unraced as a juvenile and showed solid, but unremarkable form in his first four starts as a three-year-old in 1913 before recording a 50/1 upset victory in the St Leger. He failed to win or place in five subsequent races and was retired at the end of 1914. He has been described as one of the worst classic winners of the 20th century. He made no impact as a breeding stallion. It was said of him \\"Night Hawk has only one speed, but he stays forever\\". ==Background== Night Hawk was a bay horse bred by his owner William Hall Walker in County Kildare, Ireland (then a part of the United Kingdom). He was sent into training with William Thomas \\"Jack\\" Robinson at his Foxhill stables in Wiltshire. Night Hawk's sire Gallinule was an exceptionally fast and precocious horse who won the National Breeders' Produce Stakes as a juvenile in 1886. He later became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Pretty Polly and Wildfowler. Night Hawk was one of ten winners produced by the broodmare Jean's Folly. Her dam, Black Cherry, was a moderate racehorse, but a great success at stud, being the direct female ancestor of numerous successful Thoroughbreds including Blandford, Sun Chariot, Carrozza, Sherluck, Santa Claus, Shahrastani. ==Racing career== ===1913: three-year-old season=== Night Hawk's owner William Hall Walker Having been unraced as a juvenile, Night Hawk made his racecourse debut at Hurst Park in late May when he ran fourth behind Fairy King, Pandeen and Aghdoe in a race over one mile. In the St George Stakes over eleven furlongs at Liverpool on 23 July Night Hawk finished second to Aghdoe with the Epsom Derby winner Aboyeur in third. He then returned to Hurst Park and ran second to Birlingham over ten furlongs. At Derby Racecourse in early September Night Hawk ran third behind Roseworthy and the 2000 Guineas winner Louvois, receiving fifteen pounds in weight from the first two. On 10 September Night Hawk contested the 138th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs on unusually hard ground at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Elijah Wheatley he started a 50/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field which included Louvois (the 9/4 favourite), Aghdoe, Bachelor's Wedding (Irish Derby, Roseworthy, Birlingham and Seremond Richmond Stakes. Louvois led and set a very fast pace until half a mile from the finish when he gave way to Seremond who was in turn overtaken by Jack Joel's White Magic. Night Hawk, however, having been tailed-off in last place at one point, made rapid progress through the field, took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won \\"easily\\" by two lengths from White Magic, with three lengths back to Seremond in third. The winning time of 3:03.6 was a new record for the race. William Hall Walker, who did not attend the race, was recording his first success in the St Leger, although he had bred two previous winners of the classic in Prince Palatine and Minoru. An unusual feature of the result was that while the first three home were all outsiders, the first three in the betting- Louvois, Aghdoe and Bachelor's Wedding were the last three to finish. In October Night Hawk started joint-favourite for the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse but looked beaten a long way from home and finished unplaced behind the 50/1 winner Fiz-Yama. On 5 November Night Hawk finished last of the five runners in the Liverpool St Leger. Night Hawk ended the season with earnings of ¬£6,450. ===1914: four- year-old season=== Night Hawk remainedin training asafour-year-old but failed to win a race. At Royal Ascot in June he finished ninth of the ten runners behind the five-year-old Aleppo the Ascot Gold Cup. In late July he ran unplaced behind Collodion in the Goodwood Plate over two miles and three furlongs. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Night Hawk as the worst St Leger winner of the 20th century. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Night Hawk was retired to become a breeding stallion and was subsequently exported to stand in New South Wales, Australia. Bought for 500 guineas by Reginald White of the Merton Stud, he arrived in Sydney on 25 November 1918, but by that time, White had decided to sell his stud farm. He was sold to the Martindale Stud at Muswellbrook in April 1919. Night Hawk had very little success as a sire of winners. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1910 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 3-o Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Night Hawk (horse)"},{"id":"56683575","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Wake Forest Demon Deacons women's basketball team represents Wake Forest University during the 2017‚Äì18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

The 1930s D√∫chas Folklore collection give the following accounts of a battle fought there- (1) A battle was fought in Croc√°n na gCamps, Derryconnessy; Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Croc√°n na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. There are Ogham stones at Croc√°n na gCampa. (2) Long ago, when the early colonists came into this country, they had a big battle on the land now owned by Mr. Francis McGovern, Tonlagee, Corlough, Bawnboy, Co. Cavan. The field in which one army pitched their campaign is now called Cnoc√°n na gCampa which means 'The little hill of the campus'. It is a pretty field with grass much greener than that in the neighbouring fields. Beside it, is the field where the battle was fought. It is a grey field covered with large stones which are said to be monuments to the men who fell in the battle and are buried under them. It is said that if the field was dug up, the bones of the dead would be found in it. A stream runs by the battle fields, and touches it on the two sides. The stream is almost choked up by big stones, and there are two stones among them, with old Irish writing on them. This is all the information that is available, about the battle in this district. It is not known exactly, what tribes had the battle, but it is known that it took place thousands of years ago. The fields are along the main road from Swanlinbar to Ballinamore. ==References== ==External links== *The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:Townlands of County Cavan ","title":"Tonlegee"},{"id":"56683615","text":"A mass mortality event (MME) is an incident that kills a vast number of individuals of a single species in a short period of time. The event may put a species at risk of extinction or upset an ecosystem. This is distinct from the mass die-off associated with short lived and synchronous emergent insect taxa which is a regular and non-catastrophic occurrence. Causes of MME's include disease and human-related activities such as pollution. Climatic extremes and other environmental influences such as oxygen stress in aquatic environments play a role, as does starvation. In many MME's there are multiple stressors. An analysis of such events from 1940 to 2012 found that these events have become more common for birds, fish and marine invertebrates, but have declined for amphibians and reptiles and not changed for mammals. ==Known mass mortality events== === Harbour seals (1988) === In 1988, the death of 20,000 harbour seals in the North Sea was found to be due to phocine distemper virus. Ten years later two bacteria were implicated in the death of 1600 New Zealand sea lions. On Marion Island in 2007, some 250‚Äì300 adult male Subantarctic fur seal died in a two-week period. It was suggested but not proven that this gender-biased mortality was caused by Streptococcus sanguinis which was carried by the house mouse, an alien species accidentally introduced in the 1800s. === Mule deer (2003) === In the Inyo National Forest there are several records of large numbers of migrating mule deer falling to their deaths by slipping on ice while crossing mountain passes. This has occurred when heavy snowfalls have persisted until fall, and have been turned to ice by frequent thawing and freezing. In 2003 a rain-on-snow event encased the ground in ice, resulting in the starvation of 20,000 muskoxen on Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic. === Drum fish (2010) === In the final week of December, 83,000 dead and dying drum fish washed up along a 20-mile stretch of the Arkansas River, about 100 miles west of Beebe, Arkansas. The cause was speculated to be disease while full test results were expected after one month. === Birds (2010) === Shortly before midnight on New Year's Eve between 3,000 and 5,000 red-winged blackbirds fell from the sky in Beebe. Most were dead on the ground but some were living but dazed. Laboratory tests have been performed and the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission, the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin as well as the University of Georgia's wildlife disease study group have procured specimens of the dead birds. In addition to the blackbirds a few grackles and starlings also fell from the sky in the same incident. A test report from the state poultry lab concluded that the birds had died from blunt trauma. An unlicensed fireworks discharge was the likely cause. === Birds (2011) === The Beebe bird deaths were repeated again on New Year's Eve of the following year, 2011, with the reported number of dead birds being 5,000. On January 3, 2011, more than five hundred starlings, red-winged blackbirds and sparrows fell dead in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, US. On January 5, \\"hundreds\\" of dead turtle doves were found at Faenza, Italy. According to Italian news agencies, a huge number of the birds were found to have blue stains on their beaks that could be caused by paint or hypoxia. Over the weekend of January 8‚Äì9, \\"over a hundred\\" dead birds were found clustered together on a California Highway, while \\"thousands of dead gizzard shad\\" (a species of fish) turned up in the harbors of Chicago. === Fish (2011) === Between December 28, 2010 and January 3, 2011, 100 tons of dead fish washed ashore on the Brazilian coast. On January 3, an estimated two million dead fish were found floating in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, US. On March 7, millions of small fish, including anchovies, sardines, and mackerel were found dead in the area of King Harbor at Redondo Beach, California, U.S. An investigation by the authorities within the area concluded that the sardines had become trapped within the harbor, depleted the ambient oxygen, which resulted in the deaths. The authorities stated that the event was \\"unusual, but not unexplainable.\\" === Cows (2011) === On January 14, approximately two hundred cows were found dead in a field in Stockton, Wisconsin. The owner of the cattle has told deputies that he suspected the animals died of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), or bovine virus diarrhea (BVD). The authorities in Wisconsin sent samples from the carcasses to labs in Madison, to determine cause of death. === Saiga antelope (2015) === In 2015, some 200,000 saiga antelope died within a period of one week in a 20 km2 area of the Betpak-Dala desert region of Kazakhstan. They had gathered in large groups for their annual calving. It was determined that warm and humid temperatures had caused Pasteurella multocida, a bacteria that normally live harmlessly in their tonsils, to cross into their bloodstream and cause Hemorrhagic septicemia. This event wiped out 60% of the population of this critically endangered species. Mass mortality events are not uncommon for saiga. In 1981, 70,000 died, in 1988 there were 200,000 deaths and more recently in 2010 12,000 died. === Brumby (2019) === In 2019, an extreme heatwave with temperatures exceeding 42¬∫C in central Australia, lead to the death of approximately 40 brumbies. === Bats === In 2014, and 2018, heatwaves in Australia have killed significant portion of bat population. == Explanations == According to most scientists, massive die offs of animals are not unusual in nature and happen for a variety of reasons including bad weather, disease outbreaks and poisonings, with pollution and climate change adding to the stresses on wildlife. The U.S. Geological Service's website listed about 90 mass deaths of birds and other wildlife from June through December 12. For instance, Louisiana's State Wildlife Veterinarian Jim LaCour has stated that there have been 16 similar mass blackbird deaths in the past 30 years. According to Italy's WWF president Giorgio Tramonti, mass dove deaths like the ones that occurred in Italy have never happened before 2010. The event in Arkansas was attributed primarily to an unexpected temperature change causing turbulence, visible on NEXRAD Doppler weather radar images, above their roosting areas which disoriented them. == Apocalypse == Some Christians assert that this particular cluster of animal mass deaths is a sign of the Apocalypse. They reference a passage in the Book of Hosea in the Hebrew Bible which reads: \\"By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood,\\" and the prophecy continues \\"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.\\" The term aflockalypse was adopted by some media commentators in reference to the 2010‚Äì2011 bird deaths. Aflockalypse is a portmanteau of the words \\"flock\\" and \\"apocalypse\\". ==See also== *Harmful algal bloom ==References== == External Links == * Map of recent mass animal deaths (2) Category:Natural disasters Category:Biological events ","title":"Mass mortality event"},{"id":"56683616","text":"Shangla is a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

His father was one of the most influential bankers and patron of the arts of the Renaissance. His grandmother Dianora Altoviti was known as La Papessa on account of the influences she had held over her uncle, Pope Innocent VIII. In Rome the Altoviti and Cybo were since the times of Cosimo de' Medici Il Vecchio allies of the Medici. Bindo Altoviti's career flourished under the pontificate of Leo X and Clement VII. Of versatile genius, Antonio was initiated to the ecclesiastical career, under the protection of one of the most authoritative Florentine prelates of the early sixteenth century, Cardinal Niccol√≤ Ridolfi. Later he became the dean of the Apostolic Chamber and secretary of Paul III. After the death of Clement VII and duke Alessandro de' Medici, the Altoviti sided with Catherine de' Medici and Pope Paul III, getting into an open confrontation with Cosimo I de' Medici. In 1548, as a poke in the eye to Cosimo, Pope Paul III appointed Bindo's son, Antonio Altoviti, as Archbishop of Florence. Furious by this open affront, Cosimo I. retaliated by banning the new Archbishop from setting foot in the city and even seized all the income and assets of the diocese. The next twenty years he spend most of the time in Rome where he explicated considerable activity during the famine of Rome in 1559, alongside with his friend and ally Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza di Santa Fiora. He also took part in the Council of Trent and lived for a period in Loreto, where he built a chapel dedicated to St. Elizabeth. Because of his young age and to secure power of the Altoviti in Florence he was not appointed cardinal. After the death of Paul III (1549) Cosimo I. lost no time in asking his successors to deliver the rebellious archbishop to him, but all refused. Nevertheless, within the next years Cosimo I. manifested a policy of rapprochement with the popes in anticipation of his request to obtain the title of Grand Duke. In 1564 Pope Pius IV, Giovanni Angelo de' Medici, asked Cosimo I. to enforce the decree of the Council of Trent. Cosimo I. responded to the plea by granting forgiveness to the Altoviti and writing to Antonio Altoviti urging him to return to Florence to take command of his diocese and begin a process of reformation. Antonio Altoviti finally took possession of the archdiocese in 1567. He entered the Florence with so much pomp, solemnity and court of nobles, that Cosimo I. was so irritated, understanding this triumphal event as a humiliation of his sovereign authority, but ordinated in the same year his nephew Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, to whom Antonio Altoviti a mentor, succeeded him as archbishop and became Pope Leo XI. The friendship between Antonio Altoviti and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, continued the reconciliation between the House of Altoviti and the new ducal branch of the House of Medici. In 1569, Pius V finally conferred the title of grand duke of Tuscany on Cosimo I. Antonio Altoviti was unanimously considered a prelate of absolute moral integrity and remarkable spiritual and cultural sensitivity. He was a man of virtue with admirable pastoral supervision, which he also wanted to emphasize in his coat of arms depicting a dog guarding a flock, with the motto non dormit qui vigilat. In 1573 he called a provincial synod but suddenly died on December 28 of the same year, fifty-two years old. He was buried in a monument behind the church of the Santi Apostoli in Florence, under the patronage of his family, in a funeral monument by Giovanni Antonio Dosio and Giovanni Caccini. == References == Category:1521 births Category:1573 deaths Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Florence ","title":"Antonio Altoviti"},{"id":"56683665","text":"The √çBV women's handball team is the women's handball department of √ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja.

In the House of Lords, Lord Mustill also agreed that \\"fair rate\\" meant \\"fair rate of expenditure\\" and did not include any element of profit. Modern Maritime Law & Risk Management - 2nd ed. - Aleka Madaraka-Sheppard - 2007 -Informa (Because it was interpreting an international convention, the House of Lords had felt constrained to interpret its provisions \\"literally\\", rather than \\"purposively\\").Unlike the EU which has the ECJ as the sole interpreter if its treaties and acquis communautaire, the Salvage Convention provides for no single arbiter. Ratifying countries thus feel cautious when interpreting the treaty. ==Significance== Following on from the innovations of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International Salvage Convention permitted salvage rewards to be made to salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for \\"Special Compensation\\", but The Nagasaki Spirit revealed that the Convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere \\"out-of-pocket expenses\\", with no allowance for any profit margin. Not only the salvors in this case, but the entire salvage industry felt disappointed and let down by this case. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&I; Clubs jointly developed the \\"SCOPIC clause\\",SCOPIC - an acronym for \\"Special Compensation - P&I; Clubs\\" which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the statutory payment provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since. ==See also== * Marine salvage * LOF * SCOPIC * Piracy in the Strait of Malacca ==References== ==External links== Category:Admiralty law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1997 in case law Category:1997 in British law ","title":"The Nagasaki Spirit"},{"id":"56683799","text":"\\"Sunk Costs\\" is the third episode of the third season of the AMC television series Better Call Saul, the spinoff series of Breaking Bad. The episode aired on April 24, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The title of the episode is a reference to sunk costs. ==Plot== After following his planted tracking device's signal to an empty stretch of highway, Mike finds it left in the middle of the road along with a ringing cell phone. He answers, agrees to the caller's request that no guns be displayed, and is told to wait for two cars to approach from opposite directions. The cars soon arrive, Gus exits one, and his men stand guard so Gus and Mike can discuss the Hector situation. They agree that Gus will no longer track Mike, and Mike will no longer try to kill Hector. Gus is amenable to Mike's continued disruption of Hector's drug business, and Mike suggests a way to draw police attention to Hector without killing him. Mike acquires cocaine from Barry Goodman, stows it in the toe of a sneaker, ties the sneaker to its mate, and throws them over a power line that spans part of the road in Mexico that he knows Hector's drug delivery trucks use. When the next truck comes, the drivers stop to stash their weapons prior to being searched at the border crossing. Mike, using a sniper rifle, fires a few rounds into the air to give them the false impression that there is a hunter or target shooter in the vicinity. The drivers finish hiding their guns, get back in the truck and pull away. Mike fires at the sneaker holding the cocaine, which causes the powder to spill onto the back of the truck. At the border crossing, drug-sniffing dogs discover the cocaine, and the drivers are taken into custody. Jimmy is arrested for breaking into Chuck's house. Following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck, Jimmy goes against Kim's advice and represents himself, pleads not guilty, and posts bail. Jimmy later explains to Kim the details of the break-in and tells her she should work on Mesa Verde business while he takes care of his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees. Kyra Hay, the prosecutor in Jimmy's case, meets with Chuck and tells him she doesn't plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck describes his wish to see a \\"better solution for everyone.\\" Jimmy talks with Kim outside the Wexler-McGill office and informs her he can avoid jail time if he confesses to the break-in and submits his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim changes her mind about helping Jimmy and persuades him to let her help fight Chuck's plan. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== Upon airing, the episode received 1.52 million American viewers, and an 18‚Äì49 rating of 0.5. ===Critical reception=== The episode received critical acclaim, on Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds a 100% rating with an average score of 8.09/10, based on 13 reviews.

He lived on his grandfather's farm in Mono until 1894 when he moved with his mother to Toronto. He studied at Victoria College, before enrolling in Osgoode Hall Law School in 1902. He was called to the bar in 1907. He went on to practice law in Toronto for 28 years. ==Writing career and The Yellow Briar deception== Mitchell's first published work was The Kingdom of America (1930), an essay about Canada. In 1933 he published his first novel The Yellow Briar under the nom de plume Patrick Slater, about the experience of a poor Irish immigrant in Ontario. When it was originally published it was presented as an autobiography by the publisher. It was very popular, it was reprinted four times in 1934, eventually selling 10,000 copies at the height of the Great Depression. Even through it was eventually revealed, by The Globe, that Patrick Slater was a hoax and the work was entirely fictional it did not seem to effect the sales of the book. Mitchell would go on to write two other novels The Water-Drinker (1937) and Robert Harding (1938), but was never able to match the success he had with The Yellow Briar. ==Fraud and disbarment== In 1935 Mitchell confessed to police that he had fallen into debt and used his clients money to rescue himself, in the amount of $20,000. He made a public confession and insisted that he be charged. He was given a sentence of six months and served it at Langstaff jail farm, he was also disbarred. As a consequence printings of The Yellow Briar were discontinued. ==Death== Mitchell died in October 18, 1951 in poverty and relative obscurity.

Development started in April 2014. It will be released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux. It was released in early access for Steam August 28, 2018. ==Synopsis== The Universim is a planet management game where the player takes the role of \\"God\\" and guides the development of civilization. Each planet is randomly generated and can be colonised given enough time and technology. Initially the game starts in the Stone Age where the player needs to build basic shelters and invent fire. Buildings and society evolve as civilization progresses unlocking new buildings and technologies. Firstly an Epicentre must be built and other buildings will be developed around it. Standard housing is built automatically but the location of special buildings like Power Plants and Farms has to be specified by the player. Resources such as food, clothing and power must be managed in order to speed up development, survive long winters and cope with natural disasters. Eventually you can guide your civilisation past the Modern era to the Space era where it is possible to colonise other planets and harvest valuable resources from these planets. Each planet on Universim is dynamic and evolves throughout the game. There is weather simulation including changing seasons and natural disasters. Meteor crashes and forest fires can wreak havoc upon your civilisation and long winters can slow development. Many planets have alien inhabitants, some are friendly but others are not and have to be defended against. Your citizens, known as \\"Nuggets\\", have the ability to make their own decisions and do things their own way, this can create dangerous problems and even lead to wars which the player can attempt to stop. As well as managing development the player also has to keep their civilisation loyal and under control. The players influence is based on two elements which are Power and Wrath. Power comes from successful completion of tasks and allows the player to alter the world e.g. change the weather. Wrath is generated when the Nuggets fail to complete tasks, this allows the player to unleash destruction on the world to scare the Nuggets into action. ==Development== In April 2014, Crytivo Games started their Kickstarter for Universim aiming to raise $320,000 which was successful with them raising a total of $387,345. On June 13, 2014, PayPal put a minimum reserve of $1 million on the Crytivo Games account which meant none of their funds could be accessed until their account reached a balance of $1 million. By May 15, 2015, they took to Twitter in an attempt to break PayPal's silence and access their pledged funds. In June 2015, Crytivo Games brought The Universim to E3 to advertise the game and get feedback from the public. A Pre-alpha version of the game was released on September 15, 2015 and was available to anyone who bought access to the alpha tier of the game. This preview included a mainly spectator version of the game where players could explore a planet and construct several different buildings. The total gameplay time was about 20 minutes. On August 2, 2016, the alpha version was released after a major update. The alpha version includes more control over the population (referred to as \\"Nuggets\\"); most of the Stone Age buildings and mechanics are present, some in-depth functionality like injuries and healthcare are in place, and in- game tutorials were added. As of October 2017, development of the Medieval era has been started which will include new buildings and technologies. As of December 2018, development of the Modern era has been started which will include new buildings and technologies. The Universim is designed using a custom engine referred to as Prometheus, which in turn is based upon the Unity Engine. ==See also== * Black & White * Godus * Populous ==References== ==External links== *The Universim home page *Unity Engine * Category:Upcoming video games Category:Indie video games Category:Simulation video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Early access video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:God games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"The Universim"},{"id":"56683988","text":"Two ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Heythrop: * was a launched in 1917 and sold in 1922. * was a launched in 1940 and sunk in 1942.

It possesses a wide ascending process of the left premaxilla relative to the right premaxilla at level of the middle of the external nares as in the killer whale and Hemisyntrachelus. ==Taxonomy== Eodelphinus was originally described in 1977 as a new species of Stenella, S. kabatensis, from a partial skull found in marine deposits in Hokkaido, Japan.H. Horikawa. 1977. A new species of fossil dolphin from the Miocene deposits of Kabato Mountainland, Hokkaido, Japan. Chikyu kagaku 31(3):97-114.

The tradition originated with the Gullah in Georgia and South Carolina. The ceiling of the slave quarters at the Owens‚ÄìThomas House in Savannah, Georgia, built in the early nineteenth century, was painted haint blue. The pigment was sourced from crushed indigo plants. Indigo was a common source for haint blue prior to the American Revolution, when indigo was a common crop for plantations in the American South, but the tradition survived well after the decline in indigo cultivation. == Etymology == The word haint is an alternative spelling of haunt, which was historically used in African-American vernacular to refer to a ghost or, in the Hoodoo belief, a witch-like creature seeking to chase victims to their death by exhaustion. == Purpose == Originally, haint blue was thought by the Gullah to ward haints, or ghosts, away from the home. The tactic was intended either to mimic the appearance of the sky, tricking the ghost into passing through, or to mimic the appearance of water, which ghosts traditionally could not cross. The Gullah would paint not only the porch, but also doors, window frames, and shutters. Blue glass bottles were also hung in trees to trap haints and boo hags. But while enslaved Africans of the Lowcountry and their descendants believed in the protective power of haint blue, the cultivation of indigo to produce the dye energized the 18th-century transatlantic slave trade, thereby increasing the enslavement of Africans. As Gullah culture mingled with white southern culture, the custom became more widely practiced. The use of haint blue has lost some of its superstitious significance, but modern proponents also cite the color as a spider and wasp- deterrent. However, the color has not actually been scientifically shown to stave off bugs. The associated repellent effect may stem from the use of milk paint containing lye, which does act as an insect repellent. The blue color is also appreciated from an aesthetic standpoint for mimicking the color of the sky. ==See also == * Robin egg blue ==References== Category:African-American society Category:Culture of the Southern United States Category:Gullah culture Category:Shades of blue Category:Gullah mythology ","title":"Haint blue"},{"id":"56684115","text":"On February 4, 2018, Anthony Weber, a 16-year-old African-American male, was fatally shot by deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in Westmont, California. Deputies came to the scene because they received a 911 call. The caller claimed someone had pointed a gun at him. The deputies claimed that Weber reached into his waistband so they shot him over ten times. Deputies did not find a gun on Weber. ==Aftermath== Days after the shooting amid rising tension in the community, a meeting was called between the Sheriff's department and the community. At the meeting, tensions were high between members of the community and law enforcement. Members of the Weber family demanded to see the gun. John Weber, Anthony's older brother, asked Captain Chris Bergner if the family and community were \\"due something?\\" Bergner replied: \\"absolutely not.\\" The meeting ended in jeers after the response. The next day, Bergner claimed he could not hear the question and thought the question was \\"Don't you think we are doomed?\\" Xavier Thompson, a member of an oversight commission, responded: \\"We will not settle for spin.\\" ==Reaction== ===Family=== Weber's family were upset as his body remained in the street uncovered for hours after the shooting. Chris Bergner from the Sheriff's department, claimed that Weber was \\"a local gang member in the area,\\" but Weber's father has denied that allegation. The Weber family also denied the allegation that Weber was armed with a gun. Members of the family and local activists have demanded an independent investigation by the California Attorney General's office. Najee Ali, speaking for the Weber family, said \\"Last night's sheriff's meeting was outrageous and a waste of time.\\" She went on: \\"The family, as well as many civil rights leaders, feel no trust in the Sheriff's Department to investigate their own. That's why today the family, along with civil rights leaders, are calling upon California's Attorney General Javier Becerra to investigate.\\" ===Protests=== After the shooting, activists in Los Angeles protested the shooting of Weber. Activists from Black Lives Matter have protested Weber's death. During 2018 NBA All-Star Game weekend, activists continued to protest Weber's death. ===Sheriff's department=== The day after the shooting, the Sheriff's department had a press conference at the Hall of Justice. The Sheriff's department played the 911 call that brought deputies to the scene. Bergner defended the actions of the deputies involved in the shooting and characterized Weber as a gang member. The Sheriff's department claims the gun may have been taken. A week after the shooting, Jim McDonnell (sheriff) acknowledged the possibility that Weber was not armed when he was shot. ==References== Category:Black Lives Matter Category:2018 in California Category:African-American-related controversies Category:February 2018 events in the United States Category:Black people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:South Los Angeles Category:Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Category:2018 deaths Category:African-American history in Los Angeles Category:Law enforcement in California Category:Protests in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States ","title":"Shooting of Anthony Weber"},{"id":"56684131","text":"The 2017 British Indoor Athletics Championships was a national track and field competition for British athletes, held on 11 and 12 February 2017 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, England.

First published in 1928, the collection gathers poems that speak mostly of sailors' and pirates' lives and desires. The poems contain familiar themes for Slauerhoff: a sailor's life, the impossibility of life on land or in society, the myth of the pirate and the Flying Dutchman. ==Content== #\\"De piraat\\" (\\"The pirate\\"), a cycle of eight poems describing a pirate driven mostly by a desire for death; #Three poems, \\"Afrikaansche Elegie\\", \\"De Renegaat\\", \\"Het laatste zeilschip\\". The first two are about Europeans who live out lives of ennui (one in the colony of the Congo, and one in an unnamed jungle), and the third (dedicated to Jan Prins) is about a sailing ship that sinks after an attempt to rescue a steam-powered ship; #\\"Het eeuwige schip\\" (\\"The eternal ship\\"), a 144-line narrative poem about an \\"eternal\\" ghost ship, based on Arthur Rimbaud's \\"Le Bateau ivre\\"According to Hendrik de Vries, ; #Five poems, \\"Droomland\\", \\"Uiterste kust\\", \\"De Profundis\\", \\"Spookschip\\", \\"De vliegende Hollander\\"; the last two more with the Flying Dutchman theme, \\"Spookschip\\" (\\"Ghost ship\\") and \\"De vliegende Hollander\\" (\\"The flying Dutchman\\"); #Four poems about life at sea, \\"Columbus\\", \\"Camoes thuiskomst\\", \\"De Ontdekker\\", including one about Christopher Columbus and one from the point of view of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes; #Three poems about life at sea, \\"Brief in een flesch gevonden\\", \\"Outcast\\", \\"Zeekoorts\\", the latter a liberal translation of John Masefield's \\"Sea-Fever\\"; #Three short poems, \\"Pacifique\\", \\"De Matroos\\", \\"Uitreis van het kaperschip\\", the latter based on a poem by Tristan Corbi√®re; #\\"Dschengis\\", a dramatic poem in unrhymed verse about Genghis Khan. ===Flying Dutchman motif=== Three of the poems address the myth of the Flying Dutchman, though literary critic H. T. J. Miedema wrote in an overview article of the myth in the 1950s that Slauerhoff is \\"less of a po√®te maudit fighting against God\\" than some of his contemporaries who used the theme. The theme was familiar to Slauerhoff, who had written a Flying Dutchman poem already before 1922. Whereas other Dutch poets were inspired more by German Romanticism (particularly Richard Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder, based on a short story by Heinrich Heine), Slauerhoff arrived by way of French poets who treated the related themes of the eternal ghost ship and the dead albatross. For instance, his Rimbaud-inspired \\"Het eeuwige schip\\" had been published in 1925 already, and before 1922 he had translated Charles Baudelaire's \\"L'Albatros\\". Literary critic S. P. Uri considers \\"Spookschip\\", which makes no overt reference to the theme, a better poem than \\"The vliegende Hollander\\"; like his other poems that treat the theme implicitly, it is a \\"strong visionary and symbolic poem, filled with typical Romantic feelings of demise, death, and decomposition\\". By contrast, he treats the theme in the overt \\"Flying Dutchman\\" almost satirically, in \\"forced language and sloppy rhymes\\". Uri surmises that perhaps Slauerhoff, who was never interested in \\"typical Dutch fare\\", chose to focus on the French Romantic aspects of the myth rather than the Dutch, Calvinist ones. ===Tristan Corbi√®re=== Corbi√®re is cited as one of Slauerhoff's influences and in his early years he had identified with the French po√®te maudit. ==Publishing history== First published in 1928 by C. A. J. van Dishoeck in Bussum, it was printed twice more by the same publisher (1942, 1946). It was published (unchanged) in 1982 by Nijgh & Van Ditmar as part of Slauerhoff's collected poetic works. ==Critical responses== J. C. Bloem (in De Gids, 1929) compared the poem \\"Afrikaansche elegy\\" (\\"African elegy\\"), which opens the second section, with the work of Charles Baudelaire (esp. \\"Parfum Exotique\\"); Bloem made his comparison in an overview of new Dutch poets whose \\"raw, jarring, and purposely unpolished\\" poetry had its flaws but was a welcome change from over-stylized predecessors. Raymond Herreman (Den Gulden Winckel, 1929) praised Slauerhoff for being a young Dutch poets who reacts strongly against two different tendencies he saw in contemporary poetry‚Äîa \\"verbose and hollow romanticism\\" that attempted to ingest the entire cosmos and was ready to explode, and a school that childishly inflated the tiniest psychological imbalance to inner drama. Eldorado, according to Herreman, was a breath of fresh air with verses full of violence and warmth, and on the whole expressed a deep desire to grasp life at its fullest. Poet and critic Nico Donkersloot noted that the glory days of Dutch lyric poetry seemed to have passed, and while praising Slauerhoff as the greatest poet of his generation said Eldorado was disappointing, possibly because of high expectations. Hendrik Marsman, a fellow poet and critic, wrote a highly favorable review; in 1931, he wrote that of all contemporary poets Slauerhoff most closely exhibited the \\"original life force of the formative beginning, of the poetic force\\". He admired the apparent struggle between the formal, poetic power, whose desire is to express itself using the highest human faculty (language), a poetic power that is at the same time \\"thwarted, undermined, misled, and poisoned by nature\\". ==References== ==External links== *Eldorado, first edition (PDF) Category:Dutch poetry collections Category:1928 poetry books ","title":"Eldorado (poetry collection)"},{"id":"56684251","text":"John Frederick Shaw (1886 ‚Äì 1916) was an English professional footballer who played as a forward for Sunderland. ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1916 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Category:Footballers from Tyne and Wear Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Wallsend F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Barrow A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Date of birth missing Category:Date of death missing ","title":"John Shaw (footballer, born 1886)"},{"id":"56684286","text":"Edward Mulcahy may refer to: * Edward Mulcahy (State Department official), deputy to Assistant United States Secretary of State Nathaniel Davis * Edward Mulcahy (politician) (1850‚Äì1927), Irish-born Australian politician in Tasmania * Edward W.

She has been described by historian Robert Stacey as 'the most important Jewish woman in medieval England'. She was an English moneylender, wife and mother, who despite the increasingly difficult circumstances of the Jews in thirteenth century England, which involved regular, punitive taxation, arbitrary imprisonments, and increasing religious intolerance (Fourth Council of the Lateran, Blood Libel) advanced through advantageous marriages and business acumen. She appears to have had a close relationship with King Henry III. ==Life== Licoricia's own name is an odd one, and it reflects a fashion in early thirteenth century England, among Christian and Jewish women, for exotic names such as Floria, Saffronia, Almonda, Preciosa, Bellassez and Comtissa, and while these names were sometimes replicated in different families, Licoricia appears not to have been such a popular choice. This partly explains why her life and career show up more clearly in the record. Licoricia first appears in records in 1234, as a young widow with three sons. Her financing activities are documented from the early 1230s, when she lent money in association with other Jews, as well as by herself with an attorney.Cheryl Tallan and Suzanne Bartlet.

From this, 4,000 marks were used to fund the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey and the shrine to Edward the Confessor.Reva Berman Brown & Sean McCartney, David of Oxford and Licoricia of Winchester: glimpses into a Jewish family in 13th Century England. Jewish Historical Studies, v. 39, 2004. Upon her release, in September 1244, Licoricia returned to live with her family in Winchester, where she continued David's business and began further enterprises of her own. Over the next 30 years, Licoricia became a highly influential business woman, financing people across Southern England. At the time there were several important female Jews in the field, including Chera and Belia. Her clients included King Henry III of England and Queen Eleanor of Provence amongst other notable nobles, including Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester prior to his rebellion in the Second Barons' War (1264‚Äì67).Hillary Waterman, Licoricia of Winchester, Jewish Widow and Medieval Financier, JStore Daily, 28 October 2015. Her son Benedict became the only Jewish Guildsman in medieval England and probably anywhere else in Western Europe. This enabled him to own tenements and houses, and be a citizen, both of which were impossible for the rest of the Jewish community. Her son by David of Oxford, Asher, was imprisoned in Winchester Castle in 1287, whilst the King was attempting to impose a large taxation on the Jews (the thirteenth century witnessed immense taxation on the Jews under John and under Henry III from the 1240s), and left graffiti there, which stated in Hebrew, 'On Friday, eve of the Sabbath in which the portion Emor is read, all the Jews of the land of the isle were imprisoned. I, Asher, inscribed this'. Little evidence exists of what her other children did, but it is possible they were involved in the activities of most of the Jewish Community, such as trading, jewelry, metalwork, medicine, clerks, or scribes (the vast majority of the community was not involved in significant moneylending). It is unlikely that they were pedlars, like many of the poorest of the community. The upper limit that the Jews could charge varied between two or three pence per pound per week. The Cahorsins (a term to denote French) and Lombards could charge as much as 50 per cent ; the Jews did not have a monopoly on lending. In early 1277, Licoricia was found murdered inside her house on Jewry Street with her Christian servant, Alice of Bickton. Three men were indicted for the murders, but none were convicted, and the murder was never solved. ==Legacy== Planning permission for a statue commemorating Licoricia of Winchester and her son Asher, by the sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley to be sited on Jewry Street in Winchester was granted in August 2018, and funds are now being raised for this project, to lead people to the history of the medieval Jewish community, and their royal connections, as well as promote tolerance and diversity today, inspire women and young people, and beautify Winchester.Michael Seymour, ‚ÄùStatue plans approved for the medieval Jewish icon Licoricia who juggled being a businesswoman with being a mum‚Äú.

He is believed to have died c. 612. Taneu became pregnant after she was raped by the leader of Rheged, Owain mab Urien.

As well as this, the fact that many people in the Hen Ogledd chose to use these saints in their names is evidence for a cult of these saints in the region. This is mentioned by John Reuben Davies. John T. Koch also makes reference to this in a variety of his works.

She graduated from high school in Basel in 1940 and went to Basel University to study medicine with the ambition of being a brain surgeon. However, she was discouraged from pursuing this ambition by specialists in Switzerland as she was \\"too short, female and appeared frail!\\" She switched to studying zoology from 1943 to 1948, achieving a D.Phil. with her thesis on non-human brains, with Adolf Portmann, as her supervisor being published in 1950 in Acta Anatomica. She was awarded a 3-year scholarship at the Janggen-P√∂hn Foundation of St Gallen to carry out research on Opisthobranchs from 1950 in Villefranche-sur-Mer and Banyuls-sur-Mer.

It is found in the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a common fish and not used for food to any great extent, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==Description== The common halfbeak grows to a length of about . It is an elongated cylindrical fish, tapering slightly at both ends; the length is typically six to ten times the depth. As is typical of halfbeaks, the lower jaw is elongated (less so in young fish) while the upper jaw is short. There are many sharp teeth, and the dorsal surface of the head has a patch of enlarged scales. The dorsal fin has 14 to 16 soft rays and the anal fin has 15 to 17 soft rays, these two fins being of equivalent size and both being set far back near the caudal peduncle. There are no extra little finlets between them and the tailfin. The general colour of this fish is dark green with a silvery sheen. There are three dark longitudinal lines on the top of the back and the fins have dusky edges. A silvery line runs from the eye to the caudal peduncle, and the flanks below this are paler. In the living fish, the tip of the lower jaw is red. The lining of the abdominal cavity is black. ==Distribution and habitat== The common halfbeak is native to the sub-tropical western Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes both the Atlantic coasts of America, the Caribbean coast and the Gulf of Mexico, and its range extends as far north as the Gulf of Maine. It occurs in the shallow sublittoral zone down to depths of about in coastal areas, bays and estuaries. ==Ecology== This is a schooling fish living in surface waters. It is an omnivore, feeding on algae, pieces of seagrass, small invertebrates and fish. It is oviparous. ==Status== The common halfbeak is a common fish in most of its range and is especially abundant in the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is sometimes caught as bycatch when fishing for other species but, although it is edible, it is not much esteemed. No specific threats to this species have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== unifasciatus Category:Fish described in 1841 ","title":"Hyporhamphus unifasciatus"},{"id":"56685006","text":"The list of shipwrecks in March 1834 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded or otherwise lost during March 1834. ==1 March== ==2 March== ==3 March== ==4 March== ==5 March== ==6 March== ==7 March== ==8 March== ==9 March== ==10 March== ==11 March== ==12 March== ==15 March== ==16 March== ==17 March== ==18 March== ==19 March== ==20 March== ==23 March== ==24 March== ==25 March== ==27 March== ==28 March== ==29 March== ==30 March== ==31 March== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1834-03 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in March 1834"},{"id":"56685014","text":"Edward Pearson may refer to: * Edward Pearson (theologian) (1756‚Äì1811), English academic and theologian, Master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge * Edward J.

Located halfway between Saint-F√©licien, Quebec and Chibougamau, Lake Chigoubiche is the largest body of water in the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. This lake straddles the townships of Lorne, Bochart, Avaugour and Argenson. The Canadian National Railway runs along the northeast shore of the lake. The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-F√©licien, Quebec passes on the northeast shore of the lake. A forest road bypasses the lake. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The surface of Lake Chigoubiche is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography == ==Toponymy== During his 1732 expedition, surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin noted this toponym which derives from the Innu term \\"ushukupish\\", meaning \\"the place where les Betsis (Saw-Bees) brood\\". This toponym knows several graphic variants such as \\"Lake Chigobiche\\", \\"Lake Shecoubish\\" and \\"Ushukupis Shakahikan\\"; the latter form being the one used today by the Innus of Mashteuiatsh. From about 1950 to 1964, this body of water will be designated \\"Argenson Lake\\", after the name of the township where it is located. At the time of Normandin, the region's Native people considered the river course and Chigoubiche Lake as the shortest way to reach the Ashuapmushuan Lake which is located a few kilometers farther west. According to his exploration notes, Normandin notes the abundance of furbearing animals in this area, including beavers, caribou, foxes and martens; hunters and traders frequenting this game region.

Hirschsprung & S√∏nner A.M. Hirschsprung & S√∏nner was a Danish tobacco company based in Copenhagen, Denmark. ==History== Abraham Marcus Hirschsprung The company was founded in 1826 when Abraham Marcus Hirschsprung (1793 - 1871), who had come to Denmark from Hamburg, established a tobacco store in the basement of Hotel d'Angleterre. The hotel was then located at the corner of √òstergade (No.2) and Kongens Nytorv. Heinrich Hirschsprung painted by P. S. Kr√∏yer in 1898 A.M. Hirschsprung was still just s small company when it was taken over by two of Hirschsprung's sons Bernhard Hirschsprung (1834 - 1909) and Heinrich Hirschsprung (1836-1908). Heinrich Hirschsprung was put in charge of the commercial activities while Bernhard Hirschsprung was responsible for the production. Heinrich Hirschsprung , a passionate art collector, founded the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen. The Tobacco factory in Tordenskjoldsgade Under Heinrich and Barnhard Hirschsprung's leadership, A. M. Hirschsprung & S√∏nner grew to become one of the leading tobacco companies in the country. They purchased a property at √òstergade 6 in 1864 and replaced it with a new building in 1870. They also constructed a new tobacco factory at Tordenskjoldsgade 7-9 in the new Gammelholm neighbourhood. The factory was completed in 1866 to design by Ove Pedersen (1830-1892) and later altered by Axel Maar (1888-1978). The company was converted into a limited company (aktieselskab) in 1899. Holger Hirschsprung was appointed as CEO and the board members were H. N. Andersen, Is. Gl√ºckstadt, Bernhard og Heinrich Hirschsprung and A. B. Munter. In 1855, A.M.

He has been instrumental in the arrest and conviction of numerous \\"psychics\\", helping their victims obtain justice including financial restitution amounting to millions of dollars. He has consulted for ABC News and 20/20 as a specialist in psychic fraud. Nygaard previously was a member of the New York City Transit Police and Nassau County Police Department, retiring from service in 2008. In August 2018, Nygaard appeared as himself in episode \\"The Psychic Didn't See Him Coming\\" of the CBS true-crime show Pink Collar Crimes, which portrays his investigations of the crimes committed by self-proclaimed psychic and convicted fraudster Gina Marks. Nygaard is sympathetic to psychic fraud victims who, he says, law enforcement authorities often fail to take seriously. He is also an outspoken critic of the inconsistent prosecution of this type of crime across the United States, and advocates for prison terms for convicted psychics, rather than merely forced restitution to their victims. ==Early life== Nygaard was born in Queens, New York, and raised in the Long Island suburb of New Hyde Park. While in high school, he played on the varsity baseball, basketball, and lacrosse teams. Intending to follow his father into business, Nygaard moved to Dallas where he majored in entrepreneurship at Southern Methodist University, and graduated in 1983. However, in 1985 he changed paths and enlisted in the New York City Police Academy. ==Law enforcement career== In 1985, after graduating from the New York City Police Academy, Nygaard joined the New York City Police Department as a transit officer working in Harlem. Nygaard says \\"I was very active ... lots of arrests\\". But he says that his zealousness as a lawman rubbed many of his fellow officers the wrong way, as he had better relationships with some criminals than with his co-workers. In 1987, Nygaard moved from transit to street patrol in New York's Nassau County, and in 1991 he was assigned to investigate a rash of home-improvement scams targeting the elderly. He arrested five men who were wanted for various confidence schemes around the country, and this case gave Nygaard a taste for \\"out-conning the con\\". He became knowledgeable in the intricacies of sweetheart swindles, insurance fraud, and psychic fraud while \\"bouncing between investigative squads and federal assignments with the DEA and FBI\\". In 2007, Nygaard joined the National Association of Bunco Investigators, a trade organization for members of law enforcement and other related fields who specialize in the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of non-traditional organized crime suspects. Through their periodic reports, Nygaard expanded his knowledge of the world of confidence schemes, which include home-improvement scams, three card monte games, pigeon drops, and an ever-expanding array of cons. Nygaard says, \\"I wouldn't be the PI I am today without all the lessons I learned on the street\\". After serving a total of 21 years on the police force, Nygaard retired with a full pension in 2008. ==Private investigator career== After retiring from police work, Nygaard moved to Boca Raton, Florida, in 2008 where he had vacationed for much of his life. After decades on the street fighting the war on drugs, and \\"busting\\" criminal activity including prostitute rings, Nygaard said he just wanted to \\"sit out the rest of his days on the beach, lounging around tiki bars\\". However, he quickly became bored, and after only a couple of months, took a test and qualified for his private investigator (PI) license. Regarding working as a PI, Nygaard said, \\"I relished being able to finally wear clothes that reflected my own personal style, like fedoras and trench coats. I had been restricted to wearing a police uniform for more than 20 years, and my personal style just coincidentally blended perfectly with my new life's work\\". Initially he took standard PI jobs such as investigating unclaimed money and cheating spouses. ===Transition to psychic fraud work=== An incident in late 2008 at a neighborhood bar set Nygaard on the career path of investigating psychic scams. At a happy hour, Nygaard met two women in the medical profession and regaled them with stories about how he had outsmarted con artists and helped their victims. Shortly after leaving the bar, one of the women ‚Äì a doctor ‚Äì called him requesting a meeting alone. She was embarrassed, but revealed she had been scammed by a local psychic named Gina Marie Marks, a well-known Florida fortune-teller with a recently published pseudonymous memoir Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante. Nygaard took the case and investigated Marks, ultimately uncovering five other victims of Marks who had been defrauded of a total of $65,000. Despite having gathered this evidence, the authorities refused to press charges against Marks after she agreed to return all the money to the group of victims Nygaard had uncovered. The authorities felt that was enough, but Nygaard disagreed: Despite being impeded by authorities, Nygaard leveraged his knowledge of the criminal justice system to get Marks arrested; the case signaled the beginning of Nygaard's \\"psychic hunting\\" career. Due to the media attention Nygaard received after Marks was convicted, he started getting calls asking for help from people all over the world who had seen his name in the news. Some called from as far away as Singapore and Hong Kong, with stories about being defrauded while in the United States. He took on several other fortune-teller fraud cases in New York, California, and Florida, and was then named in more news articles. He soon became the go-to guy for psychic fraud victims. Nygaard says, \\"I guess I fill a niche, and as far as I know I'm the only one in the country doing it ... I have so much work. I'm overwhelmed\\". ===Television appearances=== ==== ABC News and 20/20==== In April 2014, ABC News did a segment on a South Florida psychic fraud case, and interviewed Nygaard. He was later hired as a consultant for segments on scammers. That led to a 20/20 piece featuring Nygaard's work, which was a \\"ratings home run, with an estimated 8.2 million viewers\\". Nygaard said that as a result, \\"My phone started lighting up, and it hasn't stopped since\\". ====Pink Collar Crimes==== On August 11, 2018, CBS first aired episode 3 of season 1 of its show Pink Collar Crimes, titled \\"The Psychic Didn't See Him Coming\\". The episode tells the story of Gina Marie Marks and of Nygaard's investigation of her crimes over a period of 10 years, from 2008 to 2018. Nygaard played himself on the show. ====Dr. Oz: The Prevalence of Fake Psychics==== On May 7, 2018, Nygaard and one of his clients (Priti Mahalanobis) appeared on the Dr. Oz television show to discuss the way in which Ms. Mahalanobis had been scammed out of $136,000 by a fake psychic in Orlando named Peaches Stevens. ===Notable psychic fraud cases=== A psychic storefront The scale of the psychic fraud problem is tremendous. Nygaard says he is familiar with a Florida case in which a woman claimed to have been defrauded of $17 million by fortune-tellers, and he personally has worked a case where his client was defrauded of $900,000. A Skeptical Inquirer article reports that, as of February 2020, Nygaard had \\"helped to cause approximately forty self-proclaimed psychics to be arrested and successfully convicted\\" and had helped victims recover in excess of $4 million. Regarding the recovery amount, Nygaard said that the $4 million reflects what his clients have actually recovered as a result of his efforts. The criminal restitution orders, he says, were for much more. However victims are largely unable to collect on such orders given that self-proclaimed psychics rarely keep any assets in their own names. Nygaard has been involved with a number of notable cases, including the following: ====Peaches Stevens==== On Jan. 11, 2012, fake psychic Peaches Stevens (AKA Mrs. Starr) of Orlando Florida was arrested on felony charges of obtaining property by fraud for having scammed Priti Mahalanobis of approximately $136,000. Ms. Mahalanobis was experiencing a number of life difficulties and was told by Stevens that there was a curse on her family that could only be removed with Stevens' help. Mahalanobis bought seven tabernacles at $19,000 each at Stevens‚Äô behest ‚Äî from Stevens ‚Äî to ‚Äúvanquish the negativity, curses and evil spirits that plagued her family,‚Äù Realizing she‚Äôd been scammed, Mahalanobis hired Nygaard, who secured an opportunity for her to appear on the Anderson Cooper show. The publicity generated by that appearance forced the Orlando State Attorney‚Äôs Office to arrest Stevens. However, after Stevens returned Ms. Mahalanobis‚Äôs money, the Orlando State Attorney‚Äôs Office chose not to pursue a criminal prosecution. ====Priscilla Kelly Delmaro and Christine Evans==== In 2015, on behalf of his client from Brooklyn, Nygaard led police to Priscilla Kelly Delmaro, who had defrauded his client of over $700,000. Delmaro had convinced her client that he and a woman named Michelle were \\"twin flames kept apart by negativity\\", and she could bring them together. After the victim learned Michelle had died, Delmaro said she would reincarnate her in another woman's body. Over Nygaard's objection, Delmaro was offered a plea bargain including a sentence of less than one year, with no requirement to pay restitution. Nygaard called the outcome a \\"travesty\\" that will encourage what he says is a booming nationwide trade in psychic scams. Christine Evans, Delmaro's mother-in-law, who worked out of the same shop as Delmaro, was later arrested due to Nygaard's intervention for another client. According to The New York Times, the arrest was a reminder that \\"fortunetelling in New York and elsewhere is often a family affair, with generations of mothers passing the tricks of the trade down to their daughters and, in this case perhaps, their sons' wives\\". ====Tammy White==== In 2015, a Times Square psychic, Tammy White (who also goes by Tammy Vlado), allegedly defrauded a Manhattan corporate executive of $55,000, causing her to lose her home. To \\"get revenge\\", the victim hired Nygaard. The two teamed up with the TV show Crime Watch Daily and recorded White telling the victim that she had a curse on her that could be removed for a five-figure payment. After the episode aired, White paid the victim back, but White continued swindling others, law-enforcement sources told the New York Post. Nygaard then arranged a sting, in which White and her daughter-in- law, Pam Ufie, allegedly told the new \\"victim\\" that she was surrounded by \\"negativity\\", but White could clear her bad aura. Both \\"psychics\\" were then arrested. ====Gina Marie Marks==== Gina Marks as photographed by Nygaard, 8/31/17 In 2016, Gina Marie Marks, using the pseudonym Natalie Miller, convinced a Maryland woman that she had bad energy around her which she could fix. When Marks stopped answering the victim's phone calls after being paid $82,000 over many months, the woman realized she was being scammed and called the police and Nygaard. An arrest warrant was issued, but Marks had fled. Nygaard tracked her to Miami International Airport, and contacted the police, who took her into custody just before she boarded a flight to Barcelona. Nygaard said, \\"I saw her come in with her husband and then I followed her through the TSA line, went in (and) followed them to the gate just about 15 to 20 minutes prior to her boarding the plane and heading to Europe\\". For Nygaard, this was a repeat run-in with Marks; he was instrumental in two previous convictions in Broward County when Marks was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2010, and forced to repay more than half a million dollars to her victims. In 2018, Marks was convicted of stealing more than $340,000 from five victims over three years. In the article documenting this conviction, Nygaard was publicly thanked for his part in the case: \\"So, thank you for your work, Bob! This is justice in action\\". In September 2018, Marks was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims, with the judge stating that Marks' actions were premeditated and she preyed on vulnerable people. Also in 2018, CBS aired an episode of its show Pink Collar Crimes documenting Marks' criminal activities. ====Melissa Lee==== In 2017, Melissa Lee of Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was accused of stealing more than $100,000 from her fortune-telling clients, and pleaded not guilty to seven counts of felony grand theft. One of Lee's victims was a 25-year old aspiring actress looking for emotional support. The victim said the alleged con progressed over a period of months, resulting in \\"financial devastation\\". After she broke free of the psychic's hold, she reached out to Nygaard who tracked the missing psychic across Southern California ‚Äì through San Diego, Temecula, Pasadena, Ramona, and eventually to Woodland Hills. Nygaard told ABC News that \\"A lot of times [the victims are] going through one of three issues: something involving love, something involving money, or something involving health ... It's not a crime to be gullible. But it is a crime to steal from a gullible person\\". ====Peaches Mitchell==== In 2017, a South Florida psychic, Peaches Mitchell, also known as Psychic Sarah, was arrested for grand theft. She allegedly convinced a woman she was cursed and defrauded her of more than $30,000 and \\"a very nice Cartier watch\\" over a period of three years. The victim, who was \\"financially devastated\\" by the scam according to the arrest warrant, hired Nygaard, who successfully tracked down Mitchell. Nygaard said that \\"Peaches reeled her into her web of deceit\\" and claimed that the woman's stepmother had placed a curse on her. ====Linda Marks==== In 2017, a woman from Washington reported that she was defrauded by Linda Marks, who was operating a fortunetelling business north of Seattle, when the \\"psychic\\" claimed to be helping her with \\"spiritual cleansing and destroying evil energy\\". Eventually, suspecting a con, the woman enlisted the help of Nygaard, who said his client had paid Marks over $50,000 over many months. Mount Vernon police met with Nygaard and Seattle police, and started gathering details on Marks. Nygaard located Marks, leading to her arrest in Mount Vernon on charges of first- degree theft by deception; she was initially held on a $75,000 bail bond. A decade earlier, Marks had defrauded victims in South Florida of more than $2 million. In May 2006, Marks was convicted in U.S. District Court in Miami, but had been freed from Florida prison in 2008. ====Ann Thompson==== On May 9, 2018, according to a report in the New York Post, 42 year old Ann Thompson, was arrested in midtown Manhattan for allegedly conning two out-of-town clients ‚Äì one from Canada and one from the US Midwest ‚Äì out of more than $800,000 over five years. Authorities said Thompson, who called herself \\"Psychic Zoe\\", is a New Jersey native and \\"operated out of the second-story of a W. 35th building near Seventh Avenue\\" and she \\"was finally nabbed Wednesday morning on charges of grand larceny, scheming to defraud and fortune-telling.\\" Both victims hired private investigator Nygaard, who started working the case in 2016, resulting in a formal police report in April 2018. According to Nygaard, \\"Thompson claimed that she needed to use money and various items to perform rituals to vanquish evil spirits, demons, and curses that were allegedly plaguing the victims and various members of the victims' families.\\" At Thompson's Manhattan Criminal Court arraignment, she was ordered held on $50,000 bail for grand larceny, and her court date was scheduled for June 27. ====Sherry Tina Uwanawich==== On September 6, 2019, Sherry Tina Uwanawich (aka Jacklyn Miller), a self-proclaimed \\"Gypsy healer\\", was sentenced to 40 months of incarceration by a U.S. District Judge in Florida, and ordered to pay restitution to Nygaard's client. Uwanawich said she grew up the \\"Roma culture\\", and the women in her family all made money in fortune telling \\"at the behest of the men.\\" She had worked at low-income locations until 17 years old, when she encountered Nygaard's client, who was then 27-year-old, at the Galleria in Houston, Texas in 2007. Uwanawich gained her trust, eventually convincing her that a witch had placed a curse on her family. Uwanawich then claimed she needed large sums of money in order to lift that curse, before harm befell her and her family. The relationship between Uwanawich and her victim continued for seven years, even after Uwanawich moved to Florida. In total, through 2014, the victim turned over approximately $1.6 million dollars to Uwanawich. The money the victim, a Brazilian medical student who was suffering from depression, turned over to Uwanawich came from numerous sources, including job earnings, loan money, money borrowed from friends and family, and hundreds-of-thousands of dollars from an inheritance. The victim also paid for the psychic's services with clothing, gift cards, and a leased automobile. Following sentencing, Nygaard said: ==Concerns over inconsistent fraud prosecution== Nygaard on the job in 2015 Nygaard says that when people report to law enforcement that they are victims of psychic fraud, they are often told that it is a civil matter, and are turned away. He says that he tries to bring the case to law enforcement \\"wrapped in a bow\\", saying, \\"Listen, when this person first came in, you told them it was a civil matter ... You know what? I know differently. It's a criminal matter\\". But despite his success with high-profile convictions, Nygaard says he still often encounters resistance by law enforcement when he presents them with the evidence of psychic fraud. \\"I would like to say that things have changed, but it's like every time I walk into a new place, you're talking to a new detective or prosecutor ... Some have learned about it; a lot haven't. You still see this attitude that, 'They did it on their own free will ‚Äî there's no crime here.'\\" For many victims, the nature of these frauds is so humiliating that the shame of coming forward outweighs the desire to get justice. Nygaard told The Atlantic that \\"he receives dozens of calls from people like college professors, CEOs, doctors, and lawyers who feel their reputations are worth more than, say, the $200,000 they were scammed out of by a psychic\\". Nygaard says that while the NYPD and the Manhattan prosecutor's office are generally supportive, the situation in South and Central Florida is very different. \\"I've had these criminals call me up and tell me Florida is open season for them ‚Äî they love it. They laugh about it because the prosecutors don't prosecute.\\" ==Comments on psychics and victims== As a result of his work, Nygaard has been an outspoken critic of psychics and mediums who take advantage of desperate people. Nygaard says that these con-artists are experts at psychological manipulation and that nationwide, this fraud amounts to \\"billions of dollars\\". He says that \\"no other victims are more maligned than victims of psychic fraud\\", and that victims are often so embarrassed at being swindled that they do not report the crime, despite being broken emotionally and facing financial disaster. \\"They don't want to see their name in the papers\\". Nygaard says that psychics anticipate and use this. He says it doesn't matter if the victim is a college professor, a lawyer or a doctor. \\"You're on their territory. And [the psychics] know how to take advantage of that.\\" Nygaard categorizes much of this type of fraud as organized crime, and says \\"It's been going on for centuries and is passed down from generation to generation. The mothers teach their daughters.\\" He says that storefront psychics appear to be financially struggling, but actually live in upscale houses and may \\"drive a Maserati\\". ==Support of organized skepticism== Beginning in 2018, Nygaard began interacting with the skeptical movement. His first interaction was as the featured guest on the Skepticality podcast where he was interviewed by Derek Colanduno. Regarding this Nygaard said, \\"I'm so happy that Derek contacted me because he opened the door, so to speak, to a whole new group of like-minded people...\\" This led to Nygaard's invitation to speak at DragonCon as part of the convention's Skeptic Track, of which he said \\"Realizing what a great opportunity it would be to help spread the word about psychic fraud, I immediately jumped at the chance to participate.\\" Besides participating in the Skeptic Track, Nygaard participated in several panels on the main conference agenda including \\"The Science of Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"James Bond Spy Class\\". Nygaard also spoke at the same convention in 2019, doing a one-hour solo presentation titled \\"Combating Psychic Fraud\\". ==Beliefs== When asked his opinion on anyone actually having psychic powers, Nygaard said, \\"Listen, no one has ever proved that they have psychic abilities since the beginning of time. And James Randi, from the James Randi Foundation, he put up a $1 million challenge to any psychic who could prove their abilities. No one has ever collected.\\" Nygaard, who identifies as Christian, says that religious leaders commonly use similar tactics in order to \\"fleece their sheep\\". He pointed to Christian televangelist Peter Popoff, who was exposed by Randi for pretending that information about people in his audience, obtained by ordinary means, was coming from God. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Video of Bob Nygaard *About Me entry for Nygaard Category:Living people Category:Detectives and criminal investigators Category:People from Queens, New York Category:Southern Methodist University alumni Category:People from Boca Raton, Florida Category:New York City Police Department officers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Bob Nygaard"},{"id":"56685224","text":"Anna Serme (born 15 May 1991 in Krnov), previously known as Anna Klimundov√° is a Czech professional squash player.

The earthquake's epicenter was west of the town of Komo. The maximum felt intensity was IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. A total of 160 people were killed and many others were injured. An aftershock of M6.0 killed 11 people on 4 March, while another aftershock of M6.7 occurred at 00:13 local time on 7 March, killing at least 25 more. A 6.3 aftershock killed another 4 people on 7 April, more than a month after the first tremors hit the area. ==Tectonic setting== Papua New Guinea lies within the complex zone of collision between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate, which converge at a rate of 107 mm per year at the earthquake's location. The Papuan fold and thrust belt, which is responsible for the mountainous New Guinea Highlands, forms the boundary between the Stable Platform area to the south and the Mobile Belt to the north. The Stable Platform consists of little deformed continental crust of the Australian Plate. The Mobile Belt consists of a series of arc terranes and continental fragments previously accreted to the Australian Plate. Current convergence across the fold and thrust belt are estimated at up to 15 mm per year. The thrusting is thick-skinned in type, involving reverse reactivation of much older extensional faults. ==Earthquake== The main shock struck at a depth of 23.4 km below the northern slopes of Mt. Sisa, and was followed by a 5.5 Mb aftershock less than 30 minutes later. The Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby characterized it as \\"typical for the Papuan fold and thrust belt\\". ===Aftershocks=== There have been more than 270 aftershocks reported by USGS in total, 68 of which were above magnitude 5, and 6 of which were above magnitude 6. { 280px  thumb } { role=\\"presentation\\" class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" +List of major earthquakes (M‚â•5.0) Earthquakes above magnitude 6 are in bold. - !No. !!Date (UTC) !!

Officials later confirmed that all of the staff were \\"safe and accounted for\\", while the administration buildings, living quarters, and mess hall had all sustained damage. The company was planning on evacuating all non-essential personnel. Flights into the Komo airfield were temporarily suspended until the runway could be surveyed. Sinkholes and landslides were reported across the affected areas, with electricity supplies also being disrupted. On 10 March, ExxonMobil officials announced that the Hides facility will not be operational for at least 8 weeks, a significant economic loss for the country. Papua New Guinea's... largest oil and gas exploration and development company Oil Search also announced it would shut down production in the Southern Highlands until it could ensure the safety of its employees. The Porgera Gold Mine suffered damage to its gas and electricity infrastructure, while landslips blocked the access road to the Ok Tedi Mine and damaged parts of the highway between Tabubil and Kiunga in the Western Province. A week after the quake, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement officials estimated that at least 7,000 people had their homes destroyed or damaged, and 150,000 people were in urgent need of emergency supplies, with food and clean water among the biggest concerns. Lack of road access and landslides were hampering deliveries in the area. By 7 March the number of displaced people had risen to 17,000, with continuing problems due to damaged roads and communication difficulties. The first UNDAC situational overview was released on 10 March, prepared in collaboration with local and international agencies. Over 544,000 people were reported to be affected by the quake, with half of them being targeted for assistance, and more than 26,000 displaced across the western parts of the country. On 15 March, nearly three weeks after the earthquake, UNICEF estimated that 275,000 people were in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 125,000 children. ====Indonesia==== The quake and its aftershocks caused panic in Jayapura, the capital of Indonesia's Papua province. The country's National Board for Disaster Management later confirmed that several buildings were damaged in the Boven Digoel Regency, including a mosque, a military post, and a district office. ===Casualties=== A total of 160 people were reported to have been killed, while many others were badly injured. Hela Province had at least 80 confirmed deaths, while 45 casualties were reported from the Southern Highlands Province. On 4 March, a M6.0 aftershock killed 11 people after a landslide buried the small village of Huya. A further 25 people were reported killed by a M6.7 aftershock on 7 March. A M6.3 aftershock on 7 April caused more damage, and four people were killed when houses collapsed in Tari. ===Response=== The government of Papua New Guinea dispatched disaster assessment teams to parts of the Southern Highlands and Hela provinces following the earthquake. Members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force were also mobilised to assist with the delivery of supplies to affected people, as well as the restoration of services and infrastructure. A state of emergency was declared on 1 March for the provinces of Hela, Southern Highlands, Enga and Western, together with a promise of 450 million kina (about 138 million US$) to help deal with the aftermath of the quake.

He has an international career with his humorous manipulation act One for Two, Two for One, which he can play in nine languages,French, English, German, Italian, spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese. and his talent as a show presenter. Technically, he is a specialist in the field of scene manipulation, in cards and balls. In the popular French book Magic for Dummies, he is one of the magicians cited in the chapter \\"Ten great characters of magic in France\\".Magic for Dummies by David Pogue, translated from English by Ludovic Gorges and adapted by Bernard Bilis - Chapter 19 Ten great characters of magic in France, p. 378: Norbert Ferr√© or the art of manipulation. == Biography == === First steps === Born September 23, 1975 in Marseille of a sales manager father and a liberal nurse mother, he is the youngest of the two children of the family. He studied business, as well as sociology and psychology, and finished with a master's degree. Except for some small anecdotal food work, he will fully enter the workforce directly as a professional artist. It was at the age of 11, in 1986, that Norbert Ferr√© attended the magician Christian Preston's show at La Ciotat: it was love at first sight for this art. The gift of a traditional box of magic for children, reading all the magic books he can find, will strengthen his passion. At the age of 14, he was accepted at the Magicians Club of Marseille, affiliated to the F.F.A.P. F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Artistes Prestidigitateurs: the national French federation of conjuring artists), a club of which he will become a few years later the president from 1998 to 2001. He was 22 years old at the time and became the youngest president of an FFAP club. He used at the time the pseudonym Maginor that he will give up in the year 1999 to present himself since under his patronymic real.Source: an interview with the magical Italian magazine Magia Moderna May 2016 N ¬∞ 2 Intervista to Norbert Ferr√© di Vittorio Marino, pages 13, 14 and 15, to the magical English magazine Magicseen September 2009 N¬∞ 28 Vol.5. N¬∞ .4 p. 22 and 23, as well as the incoming Norbert Ferr√© of the Dictionary of the Prestidigitation of Jean de Merry and Andr√© Ciocca, Editions Georges Proust. === Artistic background === Very quickly, in the different domains of prestidigitation (see illusionism, 2.2), Norbert Ferr√© will choose that of manipulation. He began, in 1989, to mount an act he decided to present in 1991, at the first magic contest Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin de Blois (he still performs under the stage name Maginor), he there wins a second prize that will encourage him. He will receive, on this occasion, the advice of Pierre Brahma, the only French at the time who won the Grand Prix at the FISM (sort of the Olympic Games of conjuring held every three years).Pierre Brahma, also from Marseille, was a Grand Prix FISM in 1964 and 1976 (one of the few to have won twice). Norbert Ferr√© continues to work on his act and presents it this time in the national contest of the AFAP (formerly name of the FFAP) in Perpignan in 1999. He wins the third prize of manipulation. He submitted his act to the 26th Convention of the Royal Club of Magicians of Brussels in Belgium (Circle 86 of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, commonly called I.B.M.), he won the second place in the category of Manipulation. Six months later, he won the same prize at the 22nd FISM convention in Lisbon.FISM ‚Äì The book Aldo Ghiurmino, W. Meister & Co. Juillet 2015, p. 270. Having finished his studies, he chose to opt for the profession of an illusionist. In September 2000, he became the first French artist to be invited by the international convention of magic organized by Tenyo. At this period, he played his shows in festivals and conventions of magic. In 2003, at the 23rd FISM convention in The Hague in July, he won a first prize in the handling category and won the Grand Prix general in all categories, becoming \\"World Champion\\"Op. cit..He became the second Frenchman in history to win the prize, succeeding Pierre Brahma, who had encouraged him during his very first competition in Blois, France. He will not compete anymore. In France, he will continue to perform in many festivals and magic conventions and will be, among others, one of the artists of the tour \\"The Night of Magic\\" programmed in many cities of the country. He will also be hired by the Crazy Horse (he will also be selected for tours abroad cabaret, the \\"Forever Crazy Horse Tour\\" in Spain, Russia...).Successfully selected and engaged by this cabaret which is notoriously considered by the profession of illusionists as a professional summit. He is now also called a lot abroad; he will travel all over the world while performing in big cabarets, the important magic festivals.Among others, in Europe: Germany: GOP Variety of Essen, Munich, Hannover, M√ºnster - Russia: Sochi, Marins Park Hotel - etc. ; In Asia: India: Trivandrum, Kerala - Japan: Yamamoto Magic Tour (Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, K√∂be, Saitama, Chiba,‚Ä¶ ) - etc. ; In North America: U.S.A.: Hollywood, The Fonda Theater (Magic Castle Ceremony); New York, Tribeca Performing Arts Center / SAM; etc. - In South America: Brazil: tour all over the country Mundial Festival Magia Tour Gustavo Lorgia; Colombia: La Castellana Teatro Nacional Tour / Mundial de Magia Tour - Gustavo Lorgia Tour (Bogota, Medellin, Bucaramanga, Cali, Soledad, Pasto, Buenaventure, Santa Marta, ... 22 cities) - etc. He will also perform in circuses.These include the First International Festival of Modern Circus \\"White Magic\\" Perm, Russia, or the end of 2017, the Swiss circus Conelli. Finally, he will be seen in TV shows around the world.For example: Le Plus Grand Cabaret du Monde (fr) presenter Patrick S√©bastien, broadcast on Saturday, September 17, 2005 at 8:45 pm on the channel France 2 - or the Russian show Golden Magic XXI (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –º–∞–≥–∏—è XXI –≤–µ–∫–∞), recorded at Crocus City Hall the 18 and 19 April 2015, aired in March 2016 at 9:00 pm on the channel Russia-1. == Prizes and awards == At the end of June 2000, he won the second place in manipulation at the 26th convention of the Royal Magicians Club of Brussels and at the 22nd FISM convention in Lisbon. In 2001, he received in Las Vegas the Originality Award of the \\"World Magic Seminar 2001\\" and in December of the same year, The Magic Circle of London inducted him in the M.I.M.C. (Membership of the Inner Magic Circle with a gold star), the highest degree for its members.Within the Magic Circle, a group never exceeding 300 members, called the Inner Circle, brings together the most eminent magicians of the world according to the criteria of the circle, members who are awarded the Gold Medal of the Magic Circle during of their admission into this group.

On July 5, 2005, he received the ¬´ Medal of the City of Marseille ¬ª.Article Medal Marseille - Norbert Ferr√© in Review of The Prestidigitation number 548 July‚ÄìAugust 2005 page 23 Author Armand Porcell. Other significant awards include in the US, The Excellence Award (The Florida State Magicians' Club - Magic on the Beach XIII) or, in Spain: 2014 commemorative plaque conferred by the city of Tamarite de Litera in Spain (Pro-Tamarit Collective - Encuentro Nacional de Magos Florences Gili). == Synopsis of the act == The synopsis resumes a parody principle of \\"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\\", somewhat in line with Jerry Lewis's \\"Dr. Jerry and Mister Love\\". On a stage with minimal decoration (a pedestal table with a box marked \\"Surprise,\\" a sign on which we read \\"Prediction\\"). Norbert Ferr√© will play two characters: the host, debonair, funny and clumsy, and the magician, very serious and skillful. The act begins with the host, whose task is to make the time pass pleasantly while waiting for the arrival of the great magician. This will be the occasion of some jokes, and a few taps, the host being very proud of his new shoes and holding to draw attention to them. After a tour of himself of the artist, the \\"great magician\\" is revealed: the act is no longer spoken, we hear, in the background, an excerpt from the musical \\"A Fiddler on the roof\\",This is the 4th song of Act I: To life. and then begins a series of manipulations, flourishes, magical effects and great dexterity with balls and cards, for a few minutes.In this part of frills with balls and mysterious re- appearances of holsters around the deck of cards, Norbert Rail has created new techniques in the magic art. The routine ends, the artist does again a turn on himself, and the first character, the debonair, makes his appearance again. This one goes to look for the sign prediction and returns it: what is marked surprises the spectators, who understands to have been handled. After some new jokes, the \\"great magician\\" is once again appearing for a new demonstration of dexterity. After this, one last time, we find the good-natured character, who will reveal the contents of the box with marked \\"surprise\\": again, the public will be surprised by what the box contains, and that is, in fact, an ultimate Magic trick. The act ends with some last touches of humour... The act combines magical effects and exploits on frills to acting, a theatralization, following a precept known illusionists statement by Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin: ¬´ The magician is a comedian who plays the role of a magician ¬ª. == Additional activities == Norbert Ferr√© occasionally writes articles for magician's magazines, such as The FFAP's magazine of conjuring.For example, the editorial of La Revue de la Prestidigitation No. 537 of September‚ÄìOctober 2003 page 2, or the article A helping hand?, Idem, No. 509 January‚ÄìFebruary 199 page 31, or the article Minor art magic or major art?, Published in the German magazine Magische Welt of December 2017 under the title: Zauberei: Kleine oder gro√üe kunst?, p.242 to 247. Since 19 March 2012, he has been president of the association \\"MAGEV - Charity magic,\\" a foundation whose aim is to offer shows, balloon sculpting workshops, etc., to children who have experienced life (illness, abuse, etc.), and to adults with disabilities.At the beginning of 2018, this foundation provided 704 magic show with scenery, sound, and lights, in 189 cities of France (including DOM), for 242 establishments visited and more than 37000 spectators. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Official website * F√©d√©ration Internationale des Soci√©t√©s Magiques * F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise des Artistes Prestidigitateurs Category:1975 births Category:French magicians Category:Talent managers Category:Vaudeville performers Category:Talent agents Category:People from Marseille Category:Magic consultants Category:Living people ","title":"Norbert Ferr√©"},{"id":"56685536","text":"Marius Niculai (born April 20, 1979) in Constan»õa, is a former Romanian rugby union football player.

At the age of 19 he graduated at Harvard College with the class of 1669 and proceeded to his degree of Master of Arts. In May, 1673, he \\" was chosen probationr , & is forthwith to take ye charge of a Classis,\\" and in the fall his fellowship was confirmed by the Harvard Corporation.

At a meeting of the Corporation, 11 December 1674, it was \\"Ordered further that hencforth Mr. Daniell Gookin be Library keeper : And that he enquire of persons formerly [con]cerned for finding out & restoring the book[s] found wanting in the last surveigh ma[de] by the Praesidt : himself and Mr Sewal as in the Library book.\\" In August, 1676, there was \\"paid mr Danl Gookin, one of the Fellowes, money 50s in Satisfaction for his paines in removing the library to the new Colledge & placeing them.\\" This was evidently extra work, for some months previously Daniel Allin had been appointed Librarian; perhaps in the removal of the books to the first Harvard Hall, then only partially completed, the new Librarian was glad to have the aid of his predecessor. Gookin, however, in June, 1679, was again \\" chosen Librarie keeper.\\" Two months later the account-books of the College have the entry, \\"Paid to Jno Palfrey 36s on the president's note for 1 doz. Stooles made for Colledge Library.\\" The following winter there is a record of payments of over 20 for freight on eleven boxes of books for the Library; probably these were the library of the English philologist and divine, Theophilus Gale, then recently bequeathed to the College. In 1681, resigning his positions at Cambridge, Gookin began his services as a minister. He seems to have assisted the Apostle Eliot in his work among the Indians at Natick, and is described by him as \\" a pious and worthy young man.\\" In March, 1685, he was ordained pastor of the church at Sherborn, with an annual salary of \\"twenty pounds in money and twenty pounds in country pay.\\" Here Gookin preached for many years, both to his parishioners and to the Indians, and here his death occurred, after a long illness, 8 January 1717/18. William Rider of Natick wrote to the editor of the News- Letter as follows : \\"The Reverend, learned and pious Mr. Daniel Gookin deceased, aged about 67 years : who in his younger Time was a Fellow of Harvard College about the space of seven years ; and since has been an Ordained Minister in said Town about 34 years ; who many years preached the Indian Lectures at Natick ; a Gentleman sound in his Doctrine, explaining the Scriptures to the weakest Capacity, and painfull in his Studies, tender of his Flock, and Exemplary in his Life, and Lamented of all Good Men that had Acquaintance with him, especially in his own Church and Town.\\" And his friend Sewall notes in his Diary : \\" He was a good Scholar, and a solid Divine. We were Fellows together at College, and have sung many a Tune in Consort ; hope shall sing Hallelujah together in Heaven.\\" ==Personal life== Gookin married, first in 1681, Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Quincy, whose father Edmund had become by that time the husband of Daniel's sister Elizabeth, the widow of John Eliot, and second, in 1692, Bethia, daughter of Edward Collicott.Savage credits him with another wife, name unknown, whom he is said to have married in 1682, but this is more than doubtful. He had seven children (Daniel, Mary, Edmund and Elizabeth by his first wife, and Bethia, Nathaniel, and Richard by his second wife).

English lyrics were published in 1965 by Ray Gilbert. \\"Fotografia\\" was one of Jobim's first compositions for which he wrote the words as well as the music. According to author Ruy Castro, this came about partly because Jobim's songwriting partner, Vinicius de Moraes, had left Rio de Janeiro to take up a diplomatic post in Montevideo, Uruguay, during much of 1958 and 1959. The change allowed Jobim to work with other lyricists, such as close friend Newton Mendon√ßa, Dolores Duran and Alo√≠sio de Oliveira, and to try his hand at penning his own lyrics. Jazz critic Gary Giddins, writing in The New Yorker, referred to \\"Fotografia\\" as an \\"ingenious\\" composition full of \\"flirtatious romance,\\" while Mark Holston at Jazziz Magazine said the song was \\"mesmerizing.\\" Thom Jurek at AllMusic called it \\"a tome of memory and longing.\\" Brazilian vocalist Flora Purim, who recorded \\"Fotografia\\" on her 2001 album Perpetual Emotion, discussed the background of the song in an interview on National Public Radio, saying, \\"in Brazil it's very common, all those illegal love affairs, people that are married but fall in love with other people that are married. So they would meet in the afternoon and be together until sunset, and then they'd have to go home to their families. And this song talks about a romance between two people and suddenly that kiss, you know, that goodbye kiss, 'I have to go now.' It‚Äôs a song about forbidden love. . . . about love affairs in the late afternoon.\\" \\"Fotografia\\" has been used as the title of other Jobim-related albums, including Wanda S√°'s 2014 Jobim tribute album, and a 2005 compilation from Planet Rhythm (Universal) entitled Fotografia: Os A√±os Dourados de Tom Jobim that includes rarities, outtakes, and previously unreleased tracks. The first recording of \\"Fotografia\\" was by Sylvia Telles in 1959, on her album Amor De Gente Mo√ßa (Musicas De Antonio Carlos Jobim). Jobim recorded the song himself as an English-language vocal on his 1967 album, A Certain Mr. Jobim. == Recorded versions== * Sylvia Telles - Amor de Gente Mo√ßa (Musicas de Antonio Carlos Jobim) (1959) * Astrud Gilberto - The Astrud Gilberto Album (1965) * Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim - A Certain Mr. Jobim (1967) * Dick Farney ‚Äì Dick Farney: Piano Orquestra: Gaya (1967); Dick Farney (1973) * Nara Le√£o ‚Äì Dez Anos Depois (1971) * Elis Regina & Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim ‚Äì Elis & Tom (1974) * Ella Fitzgerald ‚Äì Ella Abra√ßa Jobim (1981) * Rosa Passos - Curare (1991) * Jo√£o Gilberto - Eu Sei que Vou Te Amar (1994) * Joe Henderson - Double Rainbow: The Music of Antonio Carlos Jobim (1995) * Gal Costa - Gal Costa Canta Tom Jobim Ao Vivo (1999) * Dave Liebman Group ‚Äì The Unknown Jobim (2001) *Jaques Morelenbaum, Paula Morelenbaum, and Ryuichi Sakamoto - Morelenbaum 2/Sakamoto: Casa (2001), A Day in New York (2003) *Flora Purim ‚Äì Perpetual Emotion (2001) * Claudia Telles ‚Äì Tributo a Tom Jobim (2001) * Palmyra & Levita with Jo√£o Donato - Here's That Rainy Bossa Day (2002) * Eliane Elias ‚Äì Dreamer (2004) * Antonio Adolfo & Carol Saboya - Ao Vivo Live (2006) * Lisa Ono - Music Of Antonio Carlos Jobim: Ipanema (2007) * Mark Murphy ‚Äì Lucky To Be Me (2010) * Vanessa da Mata ‚Äì Vanessa da Mata canta Tom Jobim (2013) * Wanda S√° ‚Äì Photograph: The Song Of Antonio Carlos Jobim (2014) * Stacey Kent ‚Äì I Know I Dream - The Orchestral Sessions (2017) ==References== Category:1959 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim Category:Songs with music by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim Category:Bossa nova songs Category:Brazilian songs Category:Portuguese-language songs ","title":"Fotografia (Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim song)"},{"id":"56686099","text":"Pond is an unincorporated community in Johnson County, Illinois, United States.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.04, it is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye under good seeing conditions. An annual parallax shift of 27.36 mas as measured from Earth's orbit provides a distance estimate of 199 light years. It has a relatively high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at a rate of 0.208 arcseconds per year, and is moving closer to the Sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of ‚àí10 km/s. The visible component of this system is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of , showing an abnormally strong line of singly- ionized strontium (Sr II) at a wavelength of 4077 √Ö. It has an estimated 1.23 times the mass of the Sun and 1.6 times the Sun's radius. The star is about 1.9 billion years old with a rotation period of around three days. It is radiating 4.6 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of around 6,508 K. HD 2454 was the first star to be identified as a Barium dwarf, by Tomkin et al. (1989), and is the brightest such object. It displays a mild overabundance of the element barium, which is hypothesized to have been accreted when an unresolved white dwarf companion was passing through the asymptotic giant branch (RGB) stage. The visible component displays significant overabundances of three s-process peak elements that are generated during the RGB phase, as well as a mild overabundance of carbon. In contrast, it shows severe depletion of lithium and beryllium, as well as a notable underabundance of boron. The surface abundances of these lighter elements may have been altered during the mass transfer process, having been previously consumed in the core region of the companion. ==References== Category:F-type main-sequence stars Category:Barium stars Category:Pisces (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects 002454 002235 0107 Piscium, 88 ","title":"HD 2454"},{"id":"56686208","text":"Reevesville is an unincorporated community in Johnson County, Illinois, United States.

He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy from 1955 to 1957. Subsequently, he trained in pathology at the Mount Sinai Hospital from 1958 to 1962. ==Career== Rubin joined the attending staff of Mt. Sinai Hospital in 1962. He was appointed Professor of Pathology in 1968, and Chairman of the Department in 1972, at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. In 1977, he moved to Philadelphia, where he was Chairman of Pathology at Drexel University Medical School. In 1986, he transferred to the Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. He was also appointed Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1987. In 2004, Rubin was named Distinguished Professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology and Chairman Emeritus of the Jefferson Department Rubin has authored numerous original contributions in the fields of liver disease, cardiomyopathy and alcoholic tissue injury. His work has been based on clinical studies of patients, volunteers and laboratory investigations of the effects of alcohol on cells and organs. Rubin originally demonstrated that primary biliary cirrhosis is an inflammatory lesion of bile ducts. His early work refuted concept that liver disease in alcoholics is caused by nutritional deficiencies, which led to the erroneous term ‚Äúnutritional cirrhosis‚Äù. In rodents, sub-human primates and human volunteers he showed that excessive alcohol consumption is toxic to the liver independent of nutritional factors, a fact that serve as the basis of alcohol research today. Subsequently, Rubin and colleagues demonstrated the profound effects of alcohol on cell membranes, mitochondria, and other cell constituents. In a series of papers, together with co-workers in Spain, he determined that (1) alcoholic cardiomyopathy correlated with the lifetime dose of alcohol, (2) women were more susceptible to the cardiac effects of alcohol, and (3) alcoholic liver and heart diseases occurred concurrently. Rubin is the founder and editor of Rubin‚Äôs Pathology, a textbook first published in 1988, now in its eight edition. == Awards and honors == * American Medical Writer‚Äôs Award for Best Medical Textbook of the Year, 1989 *Doctor Honoris Causa, University of Barcelona, Spain, 1994 * The F.K.

In addition to being an interesting neurological process, destination memory error can cause awkward social interactions and social embarrassment. The discovery that older adults not only remembered fewer words, but also tended to repeat the same words more frequently prompted the first studies of destination memory. This experiment opened the door to investigating what we now call destination memory. Gopie & MacLeod are not only responsible for coining the term \\"destination memory\\", but for initiating the beginning of many research experiments to further our understanding of memory error. Destination memory plays a critical role in our episodic memory. It is considered an autobiographical memory because the information is recollected and remembered regarding oneself as a participant in a specific situation. Because humans are social creatures, our ability to communicate efficiently and effectively is important; therefore, remembering to whom we have told information is an important skill for successful social interactions. ==Neurological aspect== The medial temporal lobe is critical for successful destination memory. fMRI scans have demonstrated that the medial temporal lobe is involved with recollection-based memory, which includes destination memory. Mugijura et al. conducted an experiment in which subjects were asked to memorize a short fact when it appeared on a computer screen and then tell it to either a man or a woman. Later the participants were asked to recall which fact they told to which person and how confident (either high or low) they were in their answer. The subjects participated in both a practice round and second round in which they were monitored by a fMRI. Due to the activity displayed on the fMRI scans in the medial temporal lobe of the brain, they concluded that this region is critical for remembering to whom you have told information. ==Aging== Older adults have disproportionately impaired destination memory when compared to younger adults, which is due to the process of normal aging. Gopie, Craik, and Hasher coined the term destination amnesia to refer to this deterioration in destination memory. It is unclear as to what is specifically responsible for destination amnesia during aging; however, it is speculated that it is due to the general decline in memory. One's theory of mind ability is a significant predictor of destination memory ability in aging adults, as they both are positively correlated and depend upon executive functioning. Little research has been conducted to understand why destination memory deteriorates or what could slow the demise; however, older adults demonstrate improved destination memory performance when relaying information to an emotional face rather than a neutral face. Emotion improves destination memory performance for older adults as they continue to age, with negative emotions providing a greater impact. More research must be conducted to better understand ways to improve this memory error in order to prevent deterioration from aging. ==Alzheimer's disease== Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition in which brain cells degenerate and die, leading to a steady destruction of one's memory and important mental functions. Because Alzheimer's disease has been shown to significantly affect episodic memory, researchers sought to understand how Alzheimer's disease affects destination memory, since it plays a critical role in our episodic memory. El Haj, Gandolphe, Allain, Fasotti, and Antoine found that those with Alzheimer's demonstrated poor performance in destination memory due to their inability to suppress appropriate versus inappropriate information during the memory retrieval process of their experiment. In addition to studying episodic memory, El Haj, G√©ly-Nargeot and Raffard sought to investigate the relationship between destination memory in Alzheimer patients and theory of mind because both processes are cognitive abilities that support effective communication and are linked to episodic memory function. They found that Alzheimer patients demonstrated a decline in destination memory as well as 2nd order cognitive theory of mind (Mary thinks that John thinks that...), but not for 1st order cognitive theory of mind (John thinks that...). Just as destination memory ability declines with normal aging, it is also negatively affected by Alzheimer's disease. ==Social consequences== Destination memory is critical for social interactions. Remembering to whom one has told information is expected and necessary for successful social interactions. Destination memory error can lead to social embarrassment when repeating stories to someone who has already heard them. While the fleeting emotion of social embarrassment may not be viewed as a serious mistake; destination memory can pose more serious issues in society. Including times when a supervisor delegates a specific task to an employee or when a professor forgets to whom they have given a specific responsibility. Errors like these can result in a diffusion of responsibility or an inability to accomplish necessary daily activities. Additionally, destination memory error can result in problematic situations for liars, as the inability to remember to whom they have told a story could result in getting caught in telling incongruent stories. Destination memory is necessary for successful communication. == References == Category:Memory processes ","title":"Destination memory"},{"id":"56686487","text":"Euphorbia fulgens, the scarlet plume, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae, native to Mexico.

Her brother, Jean-Christophe Beno√Æt (born 1925) was a popular and much recorded baritone.Alain P√¢ris.

Denise Beno√Æt began learning the violin at the age of three from her father, later continuing with her mother. As a young woman, she began her professional life playing in Parisian theatre orchestras; while at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny a man looked into the pit and asked her whether she would not prefer to be playing on stage rather below it. Through several theatrical contacts she became the student of Jean Meyer, spent a year the Conservatoire and began her acting career in 1942.Aujourd'hui jeunes debutates, seront-elles les vedettes 1945? Regards. 1 January 1945, p15. Her break-through came with an \\"unforgettable\\" portrayal of Natalia Stepenovna in A Marriage Proposal by Tchekhov. Her first role, in Sixi√®me √©tage, was as a cleaning lady, and this debut tended to type-cast her for some time as servants, concierges and domestics. On screen she became restricted to being a secretary, a domestic and a waitress, and so began to refuse this type of role. In 1945 while a student of Andr√© Brunot at the Conservatoire d'art dramatique in Paris she took part in a televised play by Courteline; at the time she was only recognized as an actress, with her singing career yet to begin. In the 1950s, living in the Boulevard Malesherbes, Paris, already well-known on disc, she had facilities for recording at her apartment.Mme Barantin a jou√© en 1945 pour 1000 t√©l√©spectateurs. T√©l√© Magazine, n¬∞ 205, 27 September-3 October 1959, p. 46-47. L√©ontine, Jean-Christophe and Denise appeared together on record in some of the 'Chants de France' folksong series on Ducretet-Thomson.Jacqueline Gudin. L'Education musicale par le disque. Education enfantine, 15 October 1954 (Review of Ducretet-Thomson record of Chansons d'Amour et de Mis√®re.). The extensive series of records of folk songs from around France was the brain-child of her mother L√©ontine, so it was natural that the family were at the centre of these recordings.Paul Guth. La famille Beno√Æt. La Nouvelle Gazette de Bruxelles, 20 August 1950. In the 1950s she began a long association with radio broadcasting, which at the time she expressed a preference for, including for ten years on the regular programme of Louis Ducreux. While taking a respite for the birth of her first child in the early 1950s, Joseph Kosma guided her in broadening her song repertoire and wrote a few for her.Georges Quiquere. Une heure avec Denise Beno√Æt. Antoinette, n¬∞ 42, April 1959. After this, a career in cabaret began, with appearances at L'√âcluse on the Left Bank, and she sang at other venues until the birth of a daughter in 1957. == Theatre == * 1941-1942: Les Pipeaux, music-hall show, Alhambra * 1942: Sixi√®me √©tage by Alfred Gh√©ri, Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot (Madame Escalier) * 1943: Le Th√©√¢tre de Monsieur S√©raphin by Pierre-Jean Laspeyres, Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot * 1944: Sainte C√©cile by Pierre Brasseur, Th√©√¢tre de l'Oeuvre * 1944: Une demande en mariage by Anton Tchekhov, Th√©√¢tre Pigalle * 1945: N'importe comment ! by No√´l Coward, Th√©√¢tre Pigalle (Elena Krassiloff) * 1945: La Vie est belle by Marcel Achard, Th√©√¢tre de la Potini√®re * 1946: Aupr√®s de ma blonde by Marcel Achard, Th√©√¢tre de la Michodi√®re * 1952: Tartuffe by Moli√®re, Com√©die des Champs-Elys√©es * 1952: Labiche et les vaudevillistes fran√ßais, soir√©e written by Louis Ducreux, Palais des beaux-arts, Brussels * 1956: Nouvelles t√™tes et bonnes mani√®res, Trois Baudets * 1958: La Vie parisienne by Jacques Offenbach, Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal (Pauline) * 1960: Tartuffe by Moli√®re, Com√©die des Champs-√âlys√©es * 1960: Le Songe du critique by Jean Anouilh, Com√©die des Champs-√âlys√©es (the maid) * 1960: Le M√©decin malgr√© lui by Moli√®re, Festival d'Aix-en-Provence * 1961: Les Pupitres by Raymond Devos, Th√©√¢tre Fontaine * 1962: Le Malade imaginaire by Moli√®re, Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal * 1964: Les Escargots meurent debout by Francis Blanche, Th√©√¢tre Fontaine (Mademoiselle Goutte) * 1966: Les Cloches de Corneville, op√©ra-comique by Robert Planquette, Th√©√¢tre de la R√©gion Parisienne and tour in √éle-de-France * 1967: La Courte Paille by Jean Meyer, Th√©√¢tre de la Potini√®re * 1968: C'est malin ! by Fulbert Janin, Th√©√¢tre des Ambassadeurs * 1968: Br√®ve Rencontre by Noel Coward, Th√©√¢tre Saint-Georges * 1968: La Courte Paille by Meyer, tour in France, Belgium and Tunisia * 1969: Tchao! by Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon, Th√©√¢tre Saint-Georges (Madame Martinay) * 1973: Tartuffe by Moli√®re, Th√©√¢tre des C√©lestins (Dorine) == Filmography == * 1943: I Am with You directed by Henri Decoin (Irma) * 1944: L'aventure est au coin de la rue by Jacques Daniel-Norman (Jeanne) * 1945: Seul dans la nuit by Christian Stengel * 1945: La Part de l'ombre by Jean Delannoy * 1946: La Foire aux chim√®res by Pierre Chenal * 1947: Les Petites annonces matrimoniales (short) by Claude Barma * 1949: The Secret of Mayerling by Jean Delannoy (Anna Vetsera) * 1951: Journal masculin (short) by Claude Barma * 1963: L'Honorable Stanislas, agent secret by Jean-Charles Dudrumet (voice only) * 1964: La Ronde by Roger Vadim (Yvette Guilbert) * 1966: Le ca√Ød de Champignol by Jean Bastia (Juliette) == Television == * 1945: A play by Courteline, directed by Claude Barma * 1960: Le M√©decin malgr√© lui by Gounod directed by Claude Loursais (Jacqueline) * 1960: Les Joies de la vie by Raymond Devos (variety show) * 1962: Tartuffe * 1962: Mardi gras -

She was selected for the British team to run at the 2010 European Athletics Championships, she was the fourth British runner to finish behind Michelle Ross-Cope, Susan Partridge and Holly Rush, a race that saw the British team come third in the European Marathon Cup.

It repeatedly diminished in size until dissolving into the city of Pittsburgh in 1868. ==History== When Allegheny County was created in 1788, its territory extended to the north and west state lines. It was divided into seven townships, of which Pitt Township was by far the largest in area as it included all of the vast part of the county north of the Ohio River and west of the Allegheny River. The rest of Pitt Township lay between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, from their confluence at Pittsburgh (then an unincorporated village within the township) to Turtle Creek on the Monongahela and Plum Creek on the Allegheny. Pitt Township lost Pittsburgh to the creation of Pittsburgh Township in 1792. In 1795 and 1796, the county reorganized the immense portion of Pitt Township north of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers into new townships. Thereafter, Pitt Township was confined to the wedge between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Its territory was further dismembered by the creation of Wilkins Township (1821), Northern Liberties borough (1829), Peebles Township (1833), the sixth through ninth wards of Pittsburgh (1845‚Äì1846), and Oakland Township (1866). The final remnant of Pitt Township, bordering north of Oakland, was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868. There had been an earlier Pitt Township in southwestern Pennsylvania prior to the creation of Allegheny County.

The species was originally described in the genus Tamoya by Kamakichi Kishinouye in 1910. However, unlike other species of that genus, this jellyfish did not have the vertical gastric phacellae which protect the inside of the bell with nematocyst warts. As a result, it was reclassified to the genus Morbakka due to its distinctively shaped rhopaliar horns which resemble rabbit ears. Because of its painful stings, M. virulenta has been nicknamed Hikurage, which is ‚Äúfire jellyfish‚Äù in Japanese.Bentlage, Bastian; Lewis, Cheryl (2012). \\"An illustrated key and synopsis of the families and genera of carybdeid box jellyfishes (Cnidaria: Cubozoa: Carybdeida), with emphasis on the \\"Irukandji family\\" (Carukiidae)\\".

Retrieved 2018-02-14. ==Description== In common with other jellyfish in the class Cuboza, Morbakka virulenta has a box-like shape. It has rabbit like rhopaliar horns and closely resembles its close relative from Australia, Morbakka fenneri. M. virulenta is one of the largest species of box jellyfish, with tentacle lengths of about three metres at maximum extension. The maximum bell height observed in M. virulenta can range up to 250 mm and the bell width can range up to 200 mm.Toshino, Sho, Hiroshi Miyake, Susumu Ohtsuka, Kazuya Okuizumi, Aya Adachi, Yoshimi Hamatsu, Makoto Urata, Kazumitsu Nakaguchi, and Syuhei Yamaguchi. \\"Development and Polyp Formation of the Giant Box Jellyfish Morbakka Virulenta (Kishinouye, 1910) (Cnidaria: Cubozoa) Collected from the Seto Inland Sea, Western Japan.\\" Plankton and Benthos Research 8, no. 1 (2013): 1-8. The bell of M. virulenta is rectangle-shaped and covered with nematocyst warts. Morbakka virulenta can be distinguished from other species in the family by its heavily branched velarial canals as well as two rows of perradial warts with additional scattered warts. == Distribution == M. virulenta have been identified in waters off the coast of Japan in tropical and temperate waters of the neritic zone, notably the Seto Inland Sea.Toshino, Sho, Hiroshi Miyake, Susumu Ohtsuka, Aya Adachi, Yusuke Kondo, Shoma Okada, Takeshi Hirabayashi, and Tatsuya Hiratsuka. \\"Monodisc Strobilation in Japanese Giant Box Jellyfish Morbakka Virulenta (Kishinouye, 1910): A Strong Implication of Phylogenetic Similarity between Cubozoa and Scyphozoa.\\" Evolution & Development 17, no. 4 (2015): 231-39. Although the exact habitat distribution is unknown, its range may possibly extend to much of the Indo-Pacific as well as the open ocean. M. virulenta has exclusively been recorded during the fall and winter months in the Japanese region. ==Ecology== === Reproduction and development === M. virulenta prefer to breed in the morning time during the fall and winter months, the only months in which adult specimens have been observed. The metamorphosis of embryo into primary polyps has been observed to take 21 days, significantly longer than other box jellyfish. Due to the soft bottoms over which M. virulenta breed, the polyps have long stalks to compensate for being buried in the soft sediment layer on the seafloor. The metamorphosis from polyp to juvenile medusa takes M. virulenta 15 days under the right conditions, and the full maturation of the medusa takes approximately 100 days. === Toxins === While M. virulenta is known by local fishermen and divers as a dangerous species and has been described as having a fiery sting, it has not yet been confirmed if they contain the toxic venom that cause Irukandji syndrome, which can lead to heart failure and death. The venom, which is released through the nematocysts, has been identified in other species in the family Carukiidae. == References == Category:Cubozoa Category:Cnidarians of the Pacific Ocean Category:Animals described in 1910 ","title":"Morbakka virulenta"},{"id":"56686673","text":"The Boardman House Inn is a bed and breakfast located in the historic district of East Haddam, Connecticut.

He moved to New York at the age of seven. Scanlan married Harmena Ebert on April 28, 1861.

Scanlan joined the Republican Party at the dawn of Reconstruction, then two years later, accepted a position on Houston City Council representing the Third Ward. The Reconstruction Governor appointed him mayor of Houston in 1870. After collecting opinions among financiers regarding Houston's good credit standing, Scanlan recommended issuing more bonds for capital projects, such as for paving, drainage, and a new city hall complex. He characterized his own approach to public spending as prioritizing function over aesthetics, and evaluated many materials and processes to street improvement. However, his critics noted the extravagant design and cost of the Houston building housing city hall, the market house, and theater. Scanlan advocated for the purchase of lands for three parks, later indebting the City by constructing a City Hall and Market House in 1872. Scanlan invested in rail ventures, including the Texas Western Railroad and an early streetcar enterprise, the Bayou City Street Railway Company. His business activities included utility companies, such as the Houston Water Works Company and the Houston Gas Company, where he served as Vice-President. He was Houston Postmaster General from 1875 through 1879. ==Death and legacy== Scanlan died in Chicago on July 9, 1906. He is interred at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston. The Scanlan Building, a NRHP-listed property in Downtown Houston, is located on land he purchased in 1865.

It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to thirty five small greenish-yellow, almost globe-shaped flowers. It often grows in large colonies but only flowers after hot fires the previous summer. == Description == Microtis globula is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between eight and thirty five greenish-yellow flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are almost globe-shaped, about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to almost round, about long and wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are triangular, about long, wide and curved with their upper edge partly overlapping the dorsal sepal. The petals are egg- shaped, about long, wide and are surrounded by the sepals. The labellum is long, about wide and lacks an obvious callus. Flowering occurs from December to January but only after a hot or late fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis globula was first formally described in 1984 by Robert John Bates from a specimen collected near Walpole and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The specific epithet (globula) is from the Latin word \\"globulus\\" meaning \\"a little ball\\" or \\"globule\\", referring to the shape of the flowers. ==Distribution and habitat== The globular mignonette orchid grows in peaty, winter-wet areas between Albany and Northcliffe in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Microtis globula is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. It is also classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threat to the species is inappropriate fire regimes. == References == == External links == * globula Category:Prasophyllinae Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1984 ","title":"Microtis globula"},{"id":"56687022","text":"The Land Grant Act of 1850An Act Granting Right of Way, and making a Grant of Land to the States of Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama, in Aid of the Construction of a Railroad from Chicago to Mobile (9 Stat. 466) provided for 3.75 million acres of land to the states to support railroad projects; by 1857 21 million acres of public lands were used for railroads in the Mississippi River valley, and the stage was set for more substantial Congressional subsidies to future railroads.Julian E.

The generic name Cyathodes was derived from Greek \\"Cyath\\" = cup and \\"odes\\" = like, referring to the ovary encircled by cup-shaped nectary. ==Description== Cyathodes straminea is a shrub with leaves arranged in pseudowhorls. Leaves are obovate-elliptic 7‚Äì16 mm long, 3-4.5 mm wide, often with a membranous margin, and a soft, blunt point. The upper surface is glabrous, but the lower surface is covered in white wax (glaucous) with prominent parallel veins (Fig.1). Petiole 1.6-2.4 mm long. The flowers occur in summer in upper leaf axils (Fig.2) and have a strong cheesy smell, are white, bell-shaped and hermaphrodite (both male and female) with long corolla lobes and anthers exserted on thick filaments. They have 5-10 locules in the ovary, developing into red, rounded, flattened fruits to 8mm wide, reputed to be edible (raw or cooked) (Fig.3). ==Habitat== Cyathodes straminea grows frequently in open shrubby subalpine heathland and woodlands on the Dolerite mountains of the northern, central and eastern parts of Tasmania above 1000m. Usually found on medium and heavy (clay) soils in moist, rocky and windy sites, with well- drained conditions and is frost tolerant. Commonly associated with Eucalyptus coccifera, Orites revoluta, Helichrysum and Richea species. ==Cultivation== It requires a well-drained moist soil in a sheltered site. These plans are very susceptible to drought but can grow even in -7 ¬∞C. The seeds should be surface sown in ericaceous soil. It germinates within 1‚Äì2 months at 18 ¬∞C.

It was converted to a motorised infantry role at Mourmelon-le-Grand in 1939 a few days before the French declaration of war on Germany and renamed 12th Motorised Infantry Division (12e division d'infanterie motoris√©e or 12e DIM) ==History== ===World War One=== It belonged to 6th Army Corps and had its headquarters at the Reims garrison as of 1 August 1914 and was mobilised in the 6th Region. Between 1 and 14 August it was taken by train to Vigneulles- l√®s-Hattonch√¢tel and ordered to defend the region around Heudicourt and Thillot. From 14 August it began to move a position near Fresnes-en-Wo√´vre, then near Etain. It went on the offensive towards Chiers on 21 August as part of the Battle of the Ardennes and the following day fought its way towards Ugny and Doncourt-l√®s-Longuyon, followed by fighting on the Crusnes and near the farm at Puiseaux and near R√®vemont on 23rd and near Arrancy on the 24th. On 25 August it withdrew to the west towards the River Meuse and new positions near Damvillers and Consenvoye. From 27 August it defended the river crossings around Gercourt and Brieulles-sur-Meuse and from 2 September resumed its withdrawal, this time south towards Montfaucon, Jub√©court and finally Rembercourt-aux-Pots. There it took part in the First Battle of the Marne from 6 to 20 September, including around Sommaisne and Rembercourt-aux-Pots during the battle of Revigny - one of the German officers attacking it was Erwin Rommel. On 14 September it began to be pursued towards Nix√©ville and Charny before it was able to hold its position around Ville-devant-Chaumont in bois d'Haumont. On 20 September it was taken out of the front-line and moved to Mouilly and Rupt-en-Wo√´vre. From 21 September it manned the front in the Braquis region opposite √âtain until being urgently ordered to the trenches at Calonne to stop the German offensive. It marched towards Saint-Mihiel and the Hauts de Meuse and on 22 September arrived at Rupt in Wo√™vre and fought at Mouilly, the Calonne trench, Saint-Remy, positions in Les √âparges and in front of the Calonne trench-line. The front then stabilised and it was placed in a sector around the bois Loclont and Tr√©sauvaux. It made an attack on the Calonne trench on 26 December. Monument to the division's dead at point C, cr√™te des √âparges. From 17 to 21 February 1915 it was involved in fierce fighting during the battle of Les √âparges, where it was also engaged resumed on 18th, 19 and 27 March. On 18‚Äì20 March Cdt De Feriet, ¬´ Les premi√®re attaques aux Eparges ¬ª, Documents, √âtudes et m√©moires, Cellule Culture d'Arme, √âcole Sup√©rieure et d'Application du G√©nie, ANGERS, vol. Dossier A 1082 it carried out a joint attack on Verdun with the Marche Infantry Division, originally planned for 10‚Äì11 March. 12th Division was ordered to capture two bastions to its west and east, joined by a trench - the trench and eastern bastion formed two intersecting lines of fire, whilst the western bastion formed three, all reinforced with underground bunkers. The French would attack from part of a spur taken in previous attacks, 50 metres away from the German positions. The explosion of mines made little effect, as did a 45 minute bombardment from 15:15 hours on 18 March. 132nd Line Infantry Regiment led the attack at 16:05, taking spur C fifteen minutes later but the German response meant the attack was bogged down by 17:00. By 19:00 132nd Regiment had reached a mid-point between points O and X and the attack resumed at 4:45 the following morning, but was held off by German machine-gunners at point X. French artillery opened fire on the eastern point of bois des Sapins from point N at 8:30 and the attack resumed again at 9:25, but was again held off. A German counter-attack was unsuccessful at 10:00 and an hour later the line stabilised. A fresh French artillery bombardment led to new attacks at midday and 16:00, but these both proved unsuccessful. The attack resumed again on 20 March at 4:00 and by 10:00 21st Division asked 24th Brigade to organise its positions. ===Second World War=== On the declaration of war on 3 September 1939 the division at Thionville in northern France and was placed on the border opposite the German troops advancing towards K≈ìnigsmacker near the end of the Maginot Line. After a month of fighting it was relieved and went into reserve near Hirson. On 10 May 1940 the division was attached to 5th Army Corps, which formed part of 1st Army. Most of the division was sent to the Saint-Quentin area on that date, although 3e GRDI were stationed to the south of Maubeuge in accordance with the Dyle Plan, Plan Yellow and the order to occupy the Gembloux sector near Namur. 3e GRDI and the engineers of 2nd Engineer Regiment were soon moved to fight delaying actions in advance of the defensive positions between Rhisnes and Temploux. On the night of 10‚Äì11 May reconnaissance parties from these detachments advanced into Belgium and from 18:00 took up positions to the rear of the Cavalry Corps, which was holding the Tirlemont-Huy line. Meanwhile the other elements of 12th Division set off at 17:00 to avoid the Luftwaffe, which had already gained air superiority. On the morning of 12 May the first elements of the division arrived and its units deployed immediately into their positions, despite continued air attack in the Dyle region, particularly at Rhisnes and Temploux. Ahead of the positions the engineers prepared a line of twenty demolition charges, but on 13 May air attacks became more targeted and more frequent. Rhisnes and Temploux were attacked again, as was the divisional command post at Spy, Belgium, forcing it to move elsewhere. The infantry dug in and placed a line of anti-tank mines all along its front line, with artillery in camouflaged positions. By evening the division was the only French unit in the area which had arrived and was ready to fight. To the east the Germans had crossed the Albert Canal, refugees were flooding west, several cut-off Belgian units were falling back and 2nd French Cavalry Corps (made up of 2nd and 3rd Light Mechanised Divisions) was preparing to fall back after fighting all day at Hannut and Merdorp against German tanks and Stukas - 3e GRDI took over the liaison between these two light mechanised divisions. To the south the 9th French Army had lost several bridges over the Meuse and would have to counter-attack on 14 May alongside the powerful 1st Armoured Division. On 14 May Perwez was abandoned by the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais, who fell back behind the positions held by 12th Division. The French cavalry corps under general Prioux also withdrew, using its last tanks to protect 12th Division's engineers, enabling them to blow the demolition charges between Hanret and Saint-Germain and regroup at Onoz. 3e GRDI covered the final part of the cavalry corps' withdrawal and suffered heavy losses. In the afternoon German light tanks attacked 150th Infantry Regiment's positions but rapidly withdrew under fire from 225th Artillery Regiment. At the end of the afternoon 150th Regiment's 1st Battalion and the 3e GRDI were given the order to turn south and hold the crossings of the Sambre Sambre √† Floriffoux between Namur and Auvelais. From dawn on 15 May the Luftwaffe resumed its attack on the crossroads, forests and marshalling points. That morning the 8th Zouave Regiment was attacked by German tanks, who were initially sent into retreat thanks to artillery fire. However, at the end of the morning the division received the order to withdraw towards the French border. To avoid air attack it abandoned its positions at night and the division fortified a line along the Charleroi canal running through Spy, Velaine and Fleurus. At the end of the night 3e GRDI covered the withdrawal of 5e DINA before destroying eleven bridges between Floreffe and Ham-sur-Sambre and rendering one more impassible to road traffic. At dawn on 16 May the division gathered at Orneau, where it received orders to rush to the area between Godarville and Motte-Courcelles on the canal to meet a German push across the Sambre to the south. At midday the division continued to withdraw, but the routes were clogged by refugees and other troops and still under constant air attack. At the end of the day the forward parties had only just reached Gosselies and Jumet. A detachment made up of elements of 106th Line Infantry Regiment and 3e GRDI under colonel Parent fought rearguard actions against advanced German units before retiring under cover of night. During the night of 16‚Äì17 May most of the division's infantry regiments crossed the canal via the bridges at Roux and Courcelles and immediately deployed. The enemy penetrated the front in force across the Luttre bridge, which Belgian engineer units had failed to destroy, attacking and pressing 150th Regiment and 8th Zouaves, who formed the vanguard. 38e Combat Tanks Battalion and a group of reconnaissance squadrons from 3e GRDI under captain de Lannoy were given artillery support and managed to push the enemy back to the east bank of the canal. The front was re-established at 19:00, but a new order to withdraw came in and during the night of 17‚Äì18 May 12 Division took up new positions on high ground at Bavai. After German tanks attacked at Ciply on 19 May, the division's infantry was ordered to withdrew to Hainaut. The divisional commander had lost contact with his superior Ren√© Altmayer and decided to withdraw again towards Valenciennes by a night march, with 153 DIM taking up the rearguard position. On the evening of 20 May 12e DIM was switched to 3rd Army Corps and on 21 May 12 Division regrouped and headed for Bruay-en-Artois under cover of darkness. 106th Line Infantry Regiment was detached from the division on 22 May and taken north by truck to hold a fortified position between Cysoing and Mouchin, while the rest of 12th Division marched on foot from Bruay-en-Artois to Avelin. Fighting by day and marching by night, they managed to pass through encircling German troops to finally reach Dunkirk. Only 8,000 men of the division remained by this point and they were ordered to hold the French sector of the perimeter for nine days during the Operation Dynamo evacuation, holding off an overwhelmingly larger German force. The division's survivors were captured on the morning of 4 June on the beach at Malo-les-Bains. ==Commanders== ===Pre-1914=== * 18 October 1873 : general Verge * 25 November 1874 - 27 July 1875 : general Borel * 21 May 1880 - 21 February 1884 : general * 26 April 1884 : general * 17 February 1890 : general Voisin * 18 June 1892 : g√©n√©ral Brug√®re * 26 December 1893 - 30 November 1897 : general Kessler * 28 December 1897 : general Gallimard * 25 June 1899 - 30 July 1904 : colonel Hartschmidt * 23 September 1904 - 18 August 1906 : general Besson * 27 September 1906 : general Ferr√© * 17 October 1908 - 14 March 1911 : general G√©n√©ral Valabr√®gue. * 27 March 1911 : general * 1 October 1913 : general Besset * 16 October 1913 : general ===World War One=== * 17 September 1914 : general * 15 November 1914 : general * 24 July 1915 : general * 23 May 1916 : general , killed on reconnaissance in the Somme Bouchavesnes - Bois L'Abb√© area 23 September 1916 * 23 September 1916 : general * 19 April 1917 : general * 10 June 1918 - 23 d√©cembre 1918 : general ===Inter-war=== * 12 January 1919 - 10 April 1923 : general Boichut * 1 October 1931 - 16 November 1933 : general Colson * 1 January 1936 : general Loizeau ===World War Two=== * 1 April 1939 - 2 June 1940 : general Janssen ==Structure== ===World War One=== * Infantry : :: 106th Line Infantry Regiment - August 1914 to January 1917 :: 132nd Line Infantry Regiment - August 1914 to January 1917 :: 350th Infantry Regiment - January 1917 to November 1918 :: 54th Line Infantry Regiment - August 1914 to November 1918 :: 67th Line Infantry Regiment - August 1914 to November 1918 :: 26th Foot Chasseurs Regiment - January 1915 to June 1915 12e Division d'Infanterie 1914-1918 :: 142nd Territorial Infantry Regiment - August 1918 to November 1918 :: 173rd Infantry Regiment - 23 November 1914 to May 1915 * Cavalry: :: One squadron of 12th Mounted Chasseurs Regiment - January 1917 to November 1918 * Artillery : :: Three groups of 75 mm guns from 25th Artillery Regiment - August 1914 to November 1918 :: 102nd Battery of 58 mm mortars from 46th Artillery Regiment - July 1916 to July 1917 :: 102nd Battery of 58 mm mortars from 25th Artillery Regiment - July 1917 to January 1918 :: 101st Battery of 58 mm mortars from 25th Artillery Regiment - January 1918 to November 1918 :: 5th Group of 155c guns from 106th Artillery Regiment - July 1918 to November 1918 * Engineers: :: One company from 9th Engineer Regiment === 1940 === It totalled around 26,000 men at full strength, consisting of: * 150th Line Infantry Regiment from Verdun * 106th Line Infantry Regiment from Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne and Reims * 8th Zouave Regiment from Mourmelon * 25th Artillery Regiment, equipped with 75 mm guns * 225th Artillery Regiment, equipped with 155 mm court * 3rd Infantry Divisional Reconnaissance Group (GRDI) from √âpernay, with forty tanks * all the divisional service troops (telegraphers, engineers, sappers, motor transport, sanitary troops and others) == Battle honours== *Service Historique de la D√©fense, D√©cision N¬∞ 12350/SGA/DPMA/SHD/DAT du 14 septembre 2007 == Bibliography (in French)== *Maurice Genevoix, Ceux de 14 (Sous Verdun, Nuits de Guerre, La Boue, Les Eparges), Paris, √âditions Flammarion, 1949 *Commandant R. de F√©riet, La Cr√™te des √âparges, 1914-1918, Paris, Payot, 1939, 210 p. *AFGG, vol. 2, t. 10 : Ordres de bataille des grandes unit√©s : divisions d'infanterie, divisions de cavalerie, 1924, 1092 p.

Mattis and Secretary Mark T. Esper. He was appointed in October of 2017 and served until December of 2019. He was responsible for representing the United States Department of Defense (DoD) for defense policy and policy in the interagency on the Middle East. He is also a retired CIA Paramilitary Operations Officer and a United States Marine. After leaving the Pentagon, he co-founded the Lobo Institute, where he led the development of a documentary on a child soldier in the Lord's Resistance Army called My Star in the Sky. He also began serving on the board of the nonprofit Grassroots Reconciliation Group that works to rehabilitate former child soldiers, became a Special Advisor to the United Nations,https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast- yemens-ongoing-tragedy a Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, and a ABC News National Security Analyst. ==DASD service== Official DoD Photo The DASD for the Middle East is a member of the Senior Executive Service in the office of the Secretary of Defense. This individual is responsible for DoD policy and for representing the DoD in the interagency for the countries of Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Foreign Policy, and other media, reported that Mulroy accepted the position because then-Defense Secretary Mattis was looking for a ‚Äúnonpartisan and apolitical individual\\" who spent a lot of time in conflict areas to fill that office. They continued that, \\"Mulroy, who spent most of his career as a CIA paramilitary operations officer in conflict zones, would depart the department on December 1, 2019, as he had always planned to stay for two years and then move to Montana to work on the group he co-founded, the Lobo Institute.\\" Mulroy was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service for his efforts. The citation focuses on his efforts to build a comprehensive plan for Yemen, for developing a DoD policy board for Iran, and for assisting the White Helmets in Syria to escape before the Syrian government could capture them. He gave the credit to his policy team who were \\"involved in many of the major national security\\" issues of the last several years. === National Defense Strategy === In January of 2018, the DoD released the National Defense Strategy (United States) (NDS) which orders priorities for the DoD as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and then counter-terrorism. As DASD for the Middle East, Mulroy was responsible for the implementation of the NDS in that region, including shaping the future of the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and Yemen with a focus on the near peer competitors of China and Russia and efforts to stem the malign activities of Iran. === Irregular Warfare Annex === At a workshop in October of 2019 which included David Kilcullen, Ben Connable and Christine Wormuth at RAND, Mulroy officially rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex (IWA) saying it was a critical component of the 2018 NDS. He said that irregular warfare (IW) includes counter-insurgency (COIN), counter-terrorism (CT), unconventional warfare (UW), foreign internal defense (FID), sabotage and subversion, stabilization (warfare) and information operations (IO), among other areas. IW has been perceived largely as limited to the CT effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but he said it should be applied to all areas of competition, including the great powers of China and Russia and the rogue states of North Korea and Iran. Mulroy said that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with \\"aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW\\" to be competitive across these priorities. He continued that DoD would incorporate IW into policies, strategies, plans, and processes, across the joint force and not solely special operations. This would also include considering IW in force design, development, and human capital to proactively manage and determine the character, scope, and intensity of our competition in the IW environment, leading to competitive advantage and raising the cost to adversaries. He concluded that it is imperative to work by, with, and through allies and partners in these efforts to strengthen their commitment to common security objectives and increase their ability to defend their own sovereignty. Mulroy said that the deployment of conventional forces in response to Iran conducting clandestine operations against commercial shipping and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure under the cover of proxies did not have the deterrent effect expected. Mulroy advocated for using IW to respond to Iran's activities and for developing a new strategy in line with the IWA that would economize our force to deny them strategic success. === China === In August of 2019, Secretary Esper stated that China was the DoD's number one priority and that \\"they are clearly professionalizing and expanding the capacity and capabilities of the military to push the United States out of the theater (of the Middle East).\\" The DoD warned that China's efforts to gain influence in the Middle East could undermine defense cooperation between the U.S. and regional allies. Mulroy added that China had a ‚Äúdesire to erode US military advantages‚Äù using their investments for \\"economic leverage and coercion\\" and \\"intellectual property theft and acquisition.\\" He continued that the U.S. was committed to improving the capacity of its partners to fight terrorism, deter regional destabilizers and promote overall stability in the Middle East, but ‚Äì as seen in the department's decision to cancel Turkey's F-35 program ‚Äì should be prepared to make hard decisions to protect U.S. technology.\\" === Egypt === During a meeting with Egypt's Defense Minister about COIN tactics in the Sinai Peninsula, Mulroy said he saw evidence of this approach during his December of 2018 visit to the Sinai Peninsula. He also highlighted that he observed economic development projects. Al-Monitor confirmed that the northern Sinai Peninsula was experiencing ‚Äúunprecedented development projects‚Äù including plans for new housing and an industrial zone. Mulroy also explained that the IWA to the NDS calls on the DoD to use FID principles, advise and assist tactics, and IO. === Iran === In April of 2019, the U.S. designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization under the U.S. State Department's \\"maximum pressure campaign\\". This designation and the decision to withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were done over the opposition of the DoD. Mulroy said this designation did not grant DoD nor were they seeking any additional authorities to the DoD. The DoD did not believe the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists could be applied to a potential conflict with Iran. At the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), Mulroy stated that Iran posed five distinct threats. The first was the potential for obtaining a nuclear weapon. The second was maritime attacks in the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab, in which a substantial portion of energy trade and commercial goods pass. The third was Iran's support to proxies and terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, some of the Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq, and the safe-harboring of senior al-Qaeda leaders in Iran. The fourth was sending their ballistic missiles in Houthi- controlled areas of Yemen for use against Saudi Arabia and in Syria with Hezbollah to use against Israel. Cyber was the fifth threat and a growing concern. Subsequent to this statement, all of these threats materialized. Many believe the U.S. State Department's \\"maximum pressure campaign\\" is the main cause for the increase in Iran's malign activities and the desire to acquire a nuclear weapon. As a result of the attacks by the IRGC on international shipping in the Gulf of Oman in the summer of 2019, the U.S. started the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC). Mulroy stated that the purpose of the IMSC was to increase overall surveillance and security in the \\"key waterways in the Middle East.\\" These waterways include the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Oman. There have been no Iranian attacks on international shipping since the IMSC began. Mulroy initiated and directed the formation of the Iran Strategy Board (ISB) to create a forum to coordinate policy across the DoD and advocated for a \\"calibrated approach to Iran.\\" One of his stated accomplishments as DASD was preventing a war with Iran, something others in the administration pushed for as they believed a conflict between the two countries was necessary to force a regime change in Iran. ==== Killing of Soleimani ==== Qasem Soleimani On 3 January of 2020, a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad International Airport targeted and killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani of the IRGC Quds Force. When asked about possible responses by Iran, Mulroy said that the Quds Force had worldwide reach and could target American civilians. Mulroy, who advocated for the U.S. to utilize irregular warfare tactics, said this strike would increase the likelihood of a vote in Iraq's council of representatives to expel U.S. forces in their country, which did happen. He continued that Soleimani ‚Äúorchestrated‚Äù much of the Iraq insurgency that killed hundreds of U.S. servicemen and women, helped ‚Äúdesign and execute‚Äù Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs campaign in Syria, and provided support in Yemen ‚Äúthat made a humanitarian crisis even worse.‚Äù In an article in the Middle East Institute journal, Mulroy and Eric Oehlerich stated that the targeted killing of Qasem Soleimani was justified and long overdue because he was an enemy combatant who orchestrated a lethal campaign against U.S. military members, diplomats and intelligence officers in Iraq. They also made the argument that the U.S. should have started by targeting Soleimani's subordinates to disrupt their operations and that covert action authority should have been considered to provide some deniability and avoid the possibility of an all-out regional war between the U.S. and Iran. === Iraq === Mulroy told ABC News that the relationship with the DoD and the Iraqi Army was among the most compelling strategic interests in the Middle East. He explained that the U.S. helped train and equip 28 Iraqi brigades to maintain their readiness and defend their country against ISIS. Continuing, \\"five years ago, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) controlled approximately 55,000 square kilometers and more than 4 million people in Iraq lived under their oppressive rule, now they do not.\\" The Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) directly supported these efforts. The Iraqi government will continue fighting the remnants of ISIS and it will need American and coalition support to fully eliminate it. \\"The priority is to empower Iraq's professional and capable security forces to protect its sovereignty and to prevent an ISIS resurgence. The more capable Iraq's security institutions, the more resilient Iraq will be in the face of its enemies‚Äù Mulroy said. He continued that U.S. forces are present at the express invitation of the government of Iraq and anchored in the Strategic Framework Agreement signed by our two countries more than 10 years ago (in 2008). Mulroy highlighted during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) hearing that U.S. forces had gone from over 150,000 in 2008 at an expense of 150 billion U.S. dollars a year to just over 5,000 in 2019 at an expense of 15 billion U.S. dollars a year. He believed this resulted from the work the U.S. and the Iraqi military did over the years to make the Iraqis more independent. However, he said that Iran's ‚Äúcynical interference‚Äù in supporting non-compliant militias in Iraq, more loyal to Tehran than Baghdad, undermined the Iraqi government's authority, preyed on ordinary Iraqis by criminal activity and destabilized the fragile communities recently liberated from ISIS. In an interview with Kurdistan 24, he said that the U.S. would continue to support the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga to combat ISIS. On March 11, 2020, two American and one British service members were killed and 12 others were wounded when eighteen 107-mm Katyusha rockets struck their base in Iraq known as Camp Taji. The Iranian proxy group Kata'ib Hezbollah (KH) was suspected of the attack which may have been retaliation from the strike that killed their leader and IRGC Commander Soleimani. Mulroy told ABC News that if the Camp Taji attack was determined to be supported by Iran the president would likely be presented with several courses of action to respond and that it is incredibly provocative and could not have come at a \\"worst time as it risks escalation of a regional conflict at a time of an international health and economic crisis\\". The U.S. responded to these attacks the next day with strikes on several KH facilities in Iraq. === Russia === Mulroy told Foreign Policy that Russia was bolstering its position in the Middle East and views Syria as the center of its approach because it presents them with many opportunities, including re-establishing great power status in the region and improving its military capabilities. He added that part of this approach has led to Russia establishing a naval facility at the Syrian port city of Tartus and a separate coastal airbase. In October of 2018, Turkey and Russia signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Idlib, the last rebel-held territory in Syria. The agreement was supposed to provide for a ceasefire and protect the three million people living in the province. However, Syria violated the ceasefire and caused a humanitarian catastrophe. Mulroy said that Russia believes they thrive in chaos and therefore they create it. He also warned against the potential of extensive collateral damage in a possible Russian-led siege against Idlib, similar to what occurred in Aleppo three years ago. In an article in the Middle East Institute, Mulroy said there was an effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to provide authority and funding for the DoD to conduct partner force operations against Russia. This effort was under Section 1202 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), but it was confined to the U.S. European Command (EUCOM) theatre and not authorized in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) theatre, which includes the Middle East. He explained that although the European theater is important, countering Russian expansion should not be limited by geography and the U.S. needs to meet Russia in all areas with the authorities and resources to compete with them. On the issue of Russian Intelligence services conducted influence operations in the U.S., Mulroy stated in the Washington Post that, \\"Foreign intelligence services, especially the Russians, often use domestic unrest in the United States to their advantage by exaggerating that unrest through social media and influence operations. The operations often take advantage of legitimate protests, hijacking them by advocating destructive acts such as the burning and destruction of property that reduce the American people's confidence in their own government. If there is evidence that any other countries are doing this, he said, there need to be direct and real consequences for them.\\" In June of 2020, the New York Times reported that a Russian intelligence agency called the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) was paying the Taliban to kill U.S. service members in Afghanistan. Mulroy called the reports disturbing if true and said that \\"although we do not want a war with Russia there are some actions you can't accept.\\" He continued that \\"if we have solid evidence that this is being done and our forces are being killed the gloves should be hitting the floor.\\" ===Syria=== ==== ISIS ==== In April of 2019, Mulroy stated that an area the size of West Virginia had been liberated from ISIS and the physical caliphate was defeated, but ISIS was not destroyed and there were over 10,000 completely unrepentant fighters left in Syria. He believed the U.S. should be in Syria for the \\"long haul\\" with the \\"very capable partner\\" in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). He also said that the U.S. partnership with the SDF was a model to follow, like the partnerships with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban in 2001 and with the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq in 2003 as the northern front against Saddam Hussein. He continued that the U.S. must support local partners to stabilize the areas that have been liberated from ISIS's control and prevent their return. Mulroy was \\"emphatic\\" in an interview with Defense One that the SDF deserved the credit for the victory against ISIS and for keeping the pressure on ISIS so they do not return. Specifically, he said ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt just skim over it because it was an incredible feat that they (the SDF) did. Nobody in Washington did that. They did.‚Äù At a hearing before the SFRC, he said the SDF spends quite a bit of time, effort, and resources taking care of everybody else's problems by holding more than 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters from over 50 countries and the U.S. is pushing those countries to take back their citizens as \\"it is their responsibility.\\" He continued that the families of ISIS fighters that have moved into internally displaced person (IDP) camps will be the next generation of ISIS or \\"ISIS 2.0\\" if the international community does not develop a plan to rehabilitate and provide them with a future. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Mulroy said the SDF bore most of the burden when it came to defeating a caliphate. He went on to say, that the DoD could not carry out the NDS without partners like the SDF. On the large IDP camp at al-Hawl, he explained that many of the children in the camps were only learning the beliefs of ISIS the entire time they are in that camp. If the international community does not come up with a way to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into society, they are the next generation of ISIS. \\"We need to pick one. We need to fund it. And we need to do something.\\" Mulroy said. \\"If we don't do it as an international community, not just the United States, it's a problem that our children will be dealing with,\\" he continued. He said that if we don't do that, we will be back there, for sure, doing this again \\"we owe it to the people that live there, who have borne unspeakable burdens, and we owe it to the men and women that are going to come after us at the State Department, at the Defense Department, that we don't just leave this undone.\\" ==== Syrian government ==== In June of 2019, Mulroy stated that the U.S. ‚Äúwill respond quickly and appropriately‚Äù if the Syrian government uses chemical weapons again. He claimed that neither Russia and the Syrian government had shown concern for the suffering of the Syrian people and together created one of the worst humanitarian tragedies in history. He called on all sides to abide by their agreements to avoid large scale military operations and to allow \\"unfettered access\\" to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need. In July of 2018, the White Helmets organization was evacuated out of southwest Syria through Israel and into Jordan, because the Syrian government and their Russian allies were specifically targeting the members of the group for terrorist connections. Mulroy was specifically cited for his efforts \\"to support the successful evacuation of 422 volunteers and family members of the White Helmets civil defense organization in Syria.\\" ==== Turkish incursion ==== In August of 2019, Mulroy, as well as other senior DoD officials, expressed public support for the SDF after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a threat to launch a unilateral offensive into the Kurdish area of northeastern Syria, the so- called \\"Safe Zone\\" was not established. Turkey was pressing to control ‚Äî in coordination with the U.S. ‚Äî a 19 to 25 mile (30 to 40-kilometer) zone within Syria, running east of the Euphrates all the way to the border with Iraq. This zone was agreed to by Turkey and the U.S. with few public details, but many officials in the DoD were skeptical that Turkey will honor it's commitments. President Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria in October of 2019 was against the recommendations of top officials in DoD who have sought to keep a small troop presence in northeast Syria to continue operations against ISIS and act as a critical counterweight to Iran and Russia. President Trump ignored their advice and endorsed the Turkish military operation into northern Syria, removing U.S. forces and paving the way for the assault on the Kurdish minority population. Mulroy said the U.S. military presence in northeast Syria and our partnership with the SDF had been major contributors to stability in that area. Prior to the Turkish incursion, called Operation Peace Spring, Mulroy stated that if they did invade northeast Syria, the Kurdish element of the SDF will defend their people and Syrian's will endure even more suffering. The New York Times said that DoD made \\"lemonade out of lemons\\" and pieced together their strategy after it had been undermined by a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Turkish President Erdogan in December of 2018, only to have it done again by another phone call between U.S. President Trump and Turkish President Erdogan in October of 2019. They continued, that the DoD would try to piece it together again. Mulroy advocated for an international plan to deal with the problems of the ISIS prisoners and the IDP camps publicly just days before the green-lighted Turkish incursion. In early October 2019, the DoD pushed to get approval to keep a small group of forces located in Syria to be able to maintain the relationship with the SDF and continue the D-ISIS and stabilization mission. In November of 2019, the New York Times reported that Ambassador William Roebuck, the senior U.S. diplomat in Syria drafted a memorandum to the U.S. Special Envoy to Syria James Jeffrey that stated directly that the U.S. should have done more to stop the Turkish invasion into Syria. He said, ‚ÄúTurkey‚Äôs military operation in northern Syria, spearheaded by armed Islamist groups on its payroll, represents an intentioned-laced effort at ethnic cleansing and what can only be described as war crimes and ethnic cleansing.‚Äù He also warned that ‚Äúwe ‚Äî with our local partners ‚Äî have lost significant leverage and inherited a shrunken, less stable platform to support both our CT efforts and the mission of finding a comprehensive political solution for Syria.‚Äù The article said the Roebuck was the \\"second senior American official in the past week who has questioned whether the United States pressed hard enough with measures like joint American-Turkish ground and air patrols along the border, to avert a Turkish offensive into northern Syria\\" with the first official being Mulroy in an interview with Defense One. ==== Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ==== Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Raid On October 26, 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's (JSOC) Delta Force conducted a raid into the Idlib province of Syria on the border with Turkey that resulted in the death of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al- Badri al-Samarrai also known as Ab≈´ Bakr al-Baghdadi. The raid was launched based on a CIA Special Activities Center's intelligence effort that located the leader of ISIS. This operation was conducted during the withdrawal of U.S. forces northeast Syria, adding to the complexity. Several senior officials commented that this operation was only possible because of the presence on the ground in Syria allowing for the development of intelligence networks. Any further reduction in troop presence could compromise this capability. The SDF provided direct and extensive support to the operation. The U.S. stated they de-conflicted with Turkey, but they did not support the operation. Barisha, the village al-Baghdadi was killed in, was located five kilometers from the border of Syria and Turkey. Many in the U.S. intelligence community (IC) have suspicions that the Turkish government knew where al-Baghdadi was located. Barisha is located in an area heavily controlled by al-Qaeda affiliates to include Al-Nusra Front‚ÄìSRF/Hazzm Movement conflict, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Guardians of Religion Organization also known as Hurras ad-Din. Mulroy highlighted this area and the concern that intelligence and military officials had about the threats emanating from there prior to the Barisha raid. ==== U.S. occupation of Syria ==== In late October of 2019, the DoD had convinced President Trump to maintain a small presence in the Deir ez-Zor region of Syria to gain an American foothold in the local oil industry infrastructure and prevent the Syrian government from accessing their desperately-needed hydrocarbon resources. CJTF-OIR stated that they were repositioning U.S. forces to continue partnering with the SDF in order to defeat ISIS remnants, protect critical infrastructure, and to deny ISIS access to revenue sources. Secretary Esper stated that the oil fields were a substantial source of revenue for ISIS during their control and that the SDF could use the revenue now to offset the costs of keeping ISIS detainees. ==== Caesar sanctions ==== On June 17, 2020, the U.S. imposed sanctions on 39 members of the Syrian government, including Assad and his wife. This was called for under Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act named for the alias used by a Syrian, who smuggled over 50,000 pictures of Syrians tortured by the government and jihadists in the two years between the outbreak of that country‚Äôs civil war. Mulroy told Kurdistan 24 and ABC News that the Syrian government \\"has to be held accountable for what they have done to the Syrian people that resulted in over 700,000 people being killed and over 10 million being displaced‚Äù, that the international community also needs to \\"increase humanitarian aid and stabilization funding to the areas liberated from this despotic regime‚Äù and ‚Äúdo everything we can to help the Syrian people and everything we can to end the Syrian regime. They are one and the same.‚Äù They added that in 2003, Mulroy worked with the Peshmerga, in the context of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. === Yemen === In May of 2019, the Senate fell short of the votes needed to override the President's veto of legislation to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Mulroy stated that DoD's support was limited to side-by-side coaching to mitigate civilian casualties and if the measure passed it would do nothing to help the people of Yemen and may actually increase civilian deaths. In regards to the sale of weapons and munitions and foreign military sales, he said that was the responsibility of the U.S. State Department. He strongly supported the United Nations' peace talks led by Special Envoy Martin Griffiths to end the war and he pushed for the international community to come together and chart, \\"a comprehensive way ahead for Yemen.\\" Mulroy made a visit to Aden, Yemen to meet with officials from the Yemeni government prior to voting also highlighted the need for, \\"their voices to be heard.\\" Mulroy was specifically cited for his efforts in Yemen as the, \\"envisioned and initiated the Yemen Steering Initiative (YSI), a project designed to jumpstart the process to prevent Yemen from becoming a failed state. The United Nations incorporated the YSI to its planning process for stabilization.\\" In September of 2019, Saudi Arabia agreed to a cease-fire in several areas of Yemen, including the capital of Sana‚Äôa which is controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. This was part of broader efforts to end a four-year conflict that has threatened to escalate into a regional war. The UN Special Envoy Griffiths believed the ceasefire was a positive sign in the progression of the peace process that started with the Stockholm agreement. This was followed by an agreement to share power between the Southern Transition Council (STC) and the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) in October of 2019, further advancing the effort to secure a lasting peace. On January 31, 2020, the New York Times reported that three U.S. officials \\"expressed confidence\\" that Qasim al-Raymi, the emir of AQAP was killed by the CIA on January 25, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement- from-the-president-13/ in Al Abdiyah District, Ma'rib Governorate, Yemen. Al- Raymi eluded U.S. forces for years as he led what experts referred to as al- Qaida's ‚Äúmost dangerous franchise.‚Äù Yahoo News reported that Mulroy said, his death would be ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù. Al-Raymi was the target of the Jan. 29, 2017, special operations raid in which Navy SEAL William Owens (Navy SEAL) was killed. The Wall Street Journal also reported al-Raymi attempted to blow up a U.S. bound airliner on Christmas Day of 2009. Al-Raymi's actions, ‚Äúhave killed countless innocent people including an attack on a hospital‚Äù, Mulroy explained, ‚ÄúThe United States never forgets and their tenacity in pursuit removed this very dangerous person from the battlefield.‚Äù U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm reports that the U.S. had killed al-Raymi, by retweeting reports claiming that the CIA had conducted the strike. Experts considered him a possible successor to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al Qaeda overall. ==Comments on civil-military relations== In July of 2020, U.S. Army general Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a House Armed Services Committee hearing that prominent Army bases named for rebel generals are divisive and can be offensive to black people in uniform. He has recommended creating a commission to study the matter. On July 24, 2020, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed (86 to 14 in favor) Senate Bill S.4049, their version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a provision that all 10 Army bases named after prominent Confederate military leaders be renamed. On this issue, Mulroy said, American soldiers \\"should serve on bases that are named after the heroes that have sacrificed and fought for our country, not against it\\" and suggested that they should be re-named after Medal of Honor recipients instead.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reversal-army-now-open-conversation- renaming-bases-named/story?id=71151951 In September of 2020, The Atlantic reported that Donald J. Trump considered Americans who were casualties of war to be \\"Losers\\" and Suckers\\" and was against disabled veterans being allowed to march in military parades. Mulroy, who has four goddaughters that are all gold star daughters, said that he did not know what was said, but did know that our military cemeteries are hallowed ground and always will be and that no person that would be embarrassed by our wounded veterans should, \\"ever hold any elected office let alone be the President of the United States.‚Äú https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2020/09/trumps-reported-loser-remarks-give- biden-opening/168260/ Several military officials associated with multiple presidential administrations‚Äîincluding three former Trump appointees, ex- Secretary of Defense and retired Marine Corps general Jim Mattis, former White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy‚Äîcriticized Trump's response to the unrest that resulted from the murder of George Floyd. Mulroy continued that, ‚ÄúActive Army and Marine Corps units are trained to fight our nation's enemies, not their fellow Americans. American cities are not battlefields.\\" ==CIA service== Mulroy is a retired PMOO from the Special Activities Center (formerly named Special Activities Division) of the CIA. PMOOs are a hybrid of a clandestine intelligence officer and a military special operator, belonging to the Special Operations Group (SOG) within SAC. They are recruited primarily from the United States Special Operations Command and are a majority of the recipients of the rare CIA valor awards of the Distinguished Intelligence Cross and the Intelligence Star.Gup, Ted (2000). The Book of Honor: Covert Lives and Classified Deaths at the CIA. While at the CIA, Mulroy spent most of career in conflict areas. His positions included service as a Chief of a Department in Special Activities Center (SAC), a Chief of Station, a Chief of an Expeditionary Team, a Chief of Base, a Deputy Chief of a Branch in Special Activities Division (SAD) and a PMOO in a Branch in SAD, among others. His CIA awards include the Intelligence Star, the Intelligence Commendation Medal, the Career Intelligence Medal and the National Intelligence Exceptional Achievement Medal, among others. He is also a recipient of the State Department's Superior Honor Award. One of Mulroy‚Äôs assignments in the CIA was as the head or Chief of a Base on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan called Shkin. This base was described by Time Magazine as the ‚Äúmost dangerous place on earth.‚Äù https://twitter.com/mpolymer/status/1313427602166738944?s=21http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,526466,00.htmlhttps://books.google.com/books?id=_6f_3DobpdwC&pg;=PA110&lpg;=PA110&dq;=shkin,+afghanistan,+most+dangerous&source;=bl&ots;=WOCr6_wvfZ&sig;=tSVVTvPLsdcofhuAN2WE-4xOKag&hl;=en&ei;=GuxHSvr5HJ- ytweAtsTYBg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2#v=onepage&q;=shkin%2C%20afghanistan%2C%20most%20dangerous&f;=false In the book Obama‚Äôs War, Bob Woodward also explained that the CIA created Counter-Terrorism Pursuit Teams that are considered the ‚Äúbest Afghan fight force‚Äù and that Shkin base (also known as FOB Lilley) was a nerve center for their operations. https://archive.org/details/obamaswars00bobw https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2010/09/22/AR2010092206141.html In the book Madman Theory, about the foreign policy of the Trump Administration, author Jim Scuitto states that Mulroy was on the initial team into Northern Iraq in 2003 and fought along with the Kurdish Peshmerga with U.S. Army Special Forces.. In the book Mulroy describes the Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria as one of the few ‚Äúpartner forces where you can absolutely count on sticking in a fighting position with you, to the end.‚Äù ==Military service== Mulroy is a retired U.S. Marine and served as a commissioned officer and a enlisted Marine on active duty and in the reserves. He served as an Armored Crewman (United States military occupation code (MOS) 1811) of a M1 Abrams tank, a Judge Advocate (MOS 4412) and an Infantry Officer (MOS 0302). His military awards include the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, among others. His son is also a U.S. Marine serving as a Sergeant (E-5) in Force Reconnaissance (MOS 0321) with Bravo Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion and was deployed to the Philippines in October 2019. ==Other service== In September of 2020, the Atlantic Council started the Counterterrorism Study Group (CTSG), a bipartisan network of former U.S. Government professionals with extensive experience in counterterrorism policymaking and operations. The CTSG's stated purpose was to understand emerging trends and future predictions in CT and to explore creative new proposals for improving the effectiveness of current CT policies and operations. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/middle-east- programs/scowcroft-middle-east-security-initiative/counterterrorism-study- group/ Mulroy was one of these experts as well as Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, Mike Nagata, Matt Olsen, Nick Rasmussen, Russ Travers, and Owen West and others. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/middle-east- programs/scowcroft-middle-east-security-initiative/counterterrorism-study- group/ ==Advocacy for child soldiers== === My Star in the Sky === Yale University Screening Mulroy is a co-maker (along with U.S. Navy SEAL Eric Oehlerich) of the documentary My Star in the Sky, which in the Acholi language is ‚ÄúLakalatwe‚Äù. This documentary depicts a story about survival, friendship, and love between two child soldiers, Anthony and Florence Opoka. Both were abducted by the LRA, an insurgent group against the government of Uganda. Anthony was seriously injured many times. The sixth time he was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. He was thrown into a mass grave and was almost buried until someone noticed his eyes moving. He recovered with very limited medical treatment and became a celestial navigator, a skill he had learned from his father. He later became a radio operator and code-talker and was eventually made Joseph Kony's radio operator. Florence also served as a soldier. After marrying Anthony in the bush, she delivered her second child during a firefight. After the birth, she \\"stood up and tied the baby to her back, picked up her first child with one hand and her assault rifle with the other.\\" Anthony and Florence eventually escaped, continued their family, and supports children orphaned by LRA soldiers to this day. Foreign Policy reports that the documentary came about after Mulroy and Oehlerich met the Opoka's during Operation Observant Compass (OOC). Mulroy called OOC, a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù for how to address child soldiers using influence operations instead of lethal force. They worked with Non-Government Organizations (NGO)s who found mothers of child soldiers and had them broadcast messages over the radio, begging them to come home. Mulroy said that a lot of these kids didn't think they were going to be allowed back, so to have their mother get on the radio and specifically tell them ‚Äòwe want you back‚Äô made a big difference. He continued that other missions are driven by the kinetics‚Äîthis was not. Marine Corps Col. Jon Darren Duke, who previously commanded OOC, said they did everything they could to get the child soldiers to defect so they would not have to fight them by using psychological operations to ‚Äúappeal to them to lay down their arms,‚Äù he said during the screening. Mulroy said that he hopes that OOC serves as a model for future programs to address child soldiers, as well as other operations as it showed how the U.S. military can use ‚Äúsoft power, influence operations‚Äù and other aspects of so-called ‚Äúirregular warfare‚Äù to fight the problem. This documentary has been screened at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C. based think tank for international affairs, the Enough Project, a non-profit group to end crimes against humanity, Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, and the Truman National Security Project, a left-leaning national security and leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C. In April of 2020, it was announced that author Mark Sullivan will be writing a book based on the documentary \\"My Star in the Sky\\". Sullivan has written several books including the New York Times best-selling book, \\"Beneath a Scarlet Sky\\" that is currently being made into a major motion picture. === The Grassroots Reconciliation Group === Mulroy is on the Board of Directors for the Grassroots Reconciliation Group (GRG). GRG was initiated as part of a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded program called the Northern Uganda Peace Initiative (NUPI) with the objective to reconcile and rehabilitate former child soldiers of Joseph Kony's LRA. After USAID's contract with NUPI ended, co-founders Sasha Lezhnev and Kasper Agger continued helping these communities as a self-funded effort. Since 2007, GRG has worked with 38 groups and reached 2,200 people directly, and impacted more than 5000 indirectly. === Comments on the subject === In an interview for the podcast Frog Logic, a podcast primarily for the special operations community, Mulroy said, \\"I don‚Äôt think anyone became a Marine, or a SEAL, or a [CIA] paramilitary officer with the idea that they were going to fight a child.‚Äù In another interview with the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think- tank, Mulroy said, \\"In order to put an end to this practice, which I think every adult in the world should agree with, we will have to hold our partners as accountable as we hold our adversaries.\\" This statement was in response to a question about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's use of Sudanese children to fight their war in Yemen and the U.S. State Department waiving their inclusion in the list of countries that use child soldiers in violation of their obligations under the United Nations resolutions. During an interview by Lawfare, Mulroy explained that the U.S. has a law called the Child Soldiers Prevention Act that was passed unanimously by the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. This law bans the U.S. from providing military assistance or arms to countries that use children as soldiers, but the president may waive the application for specific countries if it is deemed to be in the national interest. Hogg, Charu Lata (March 28, 2016). \\"The Loophole That Lets the U.S. Government Fund the Use of Child Soldiers\\". Open Society Foundations. Retrieved November 22, 2017. Mulroy criticized the U.S. for providing a waiver for Saudi Arabia and said that the U.S. had an obligation to hold its partners to at least the same standard as it holds its adversaries. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-childsoldiers- exclusive/exclusive-overruling-his-experts-pompeo-keeps-saudis-off-us-child- soldiers-list-idUSKCN1TJ25H https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast- yemens-ongoing-tragedy He further explained there are an estimated 100,000 children fighting in over 18 countries around the world and that child soldiers use in the Middle East Doubled in 2019. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-children-soldiers/global-count- finds-cases-of-child-soldiers-more-than-doubling-idUSKCN1Q12HQ Mulroy said, \\"this is a problem that every adult should care about.\\" https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-yemens-ongoing-tragedy ==Publications== ===National security=== * For Now, U.S. Troops Are Likely in Iraq to Stay * The killing of Qassem Soleimani: Was there a better way? * A tale of two partners: Comparing two approaches for partner force operations * Russia‚Äôs Middle East: You probe with bayonets.

Also known as the R√©giment de Bagatelle, it inherited the traditions of the short-lived 150th Demi-Brigade (1794 to 1796) and 150th Line Infantry Regiment (1813 to 1814). The latter was formed by Napoleon I on 12 January 1813 to fight in Germany, where it was decimated, finally disbanding at Arras on 21 July 1814. The final regiment with the numeral 150 was formed as 150th Infantry Regiment on 25 July 1887. This fought in both World Wars, forming part of 12th Infantry Division in May‚ÄìJune 1940 and holding the French sector of the perimeter around Dunkirk, buying time for the success of Operation Dynamo and only surrendering on the beach at Malo-les-Bains on 4 June. The regiment was re-formed in the arm√©e d'armistice at Agen on 31 August 1940, but this unit was disbanded on 28 November 1942. The Free French Forces also raised a battalion named 150th Infantry Regiment on 1 September 1944 at Verdun. The regiment was definitely re-formed using marching battalions from the Free French Forces in February 1945 and took part in the liberation of Royan. At the end of 1945 it was in Paris but the following year it was disbanded and another 150th Infantry Battalion formed at Verdun. This was sent to Morocco in 1947 before being disbanded on 1 January 1949. A final motorised infantry regiment was formed with the numeral 150 on 4 January 1963, becoming mechanised infantry twelve years later and finally being disbanded in 1990. The numeral was revived in 1990 for a reserve regiment, but this too was disbanded in 1996, ending the regiment's lineage.

Later he also played a role in the early years of the French Revolution as a collaborator of Mirabeau. In that capacity he published an extract of the Dutch Leiden Draft, a manifesto that may have influenced the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. ==Personal life== Cerisier was born the son of grocer Jean Baptiste Cerisier and Marie Anne Chanrion. He was baptised together with his twin brother Jean S√©bastien as \\"Marie Antoine\\" on 21 November, but later reversed the order of his Christian names. His uncle J. Cerisier, who taught Rhetoric at the Coll√®ge des Grassins in Paris, had him educated in that city. Cerisier married Victoire de Vaulpr√© with whom he had at least nine children.Favre ==Career== Cerisier came to the Netherlands around 1775, where he became secretary to the French legation to the Dutch Republic at The Hague. He had little to do in that function and as a hobby started studying Dutch history. He wrote a total of ten volumes on that subject, mostly from the perspective of the so-called \\"States party\\" (the opponents of the Dutch stadtholders)Van der Aa, p. 295 that were published between 1777 and 1784. The French legation at the time was heavily engaged in attempts to influence Dutch public opinion in favor of France and its American allies in the American Revolutionary War. When the Republic became embroiled in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War as an ally of the French and Americans Cerisier (by then no longer a diplomat) became friendly with the new American ambassador, John Adams (apparently from their correspondence even before Adams came to the Netherlands) and the two engaged in disseminating pamphlets in favor of the American cause.See for the correspondence between Cerisier and John Adams the Founders Online archive Cerisier became a journalist who contributed to several periodicals. Together with A. Crajenschot he edited le Politique hollandais between 1781 and 1784Van der Aa, p. 296 Cerisier became around 1780 an editor of the Gazette de Leyde a French-language Dutch newspaper, published in Leiden by Jean Luzac at the time. This was a newspaper that had many contributors who favored the side of the anti-Orangist Patriot party, the opponents of stadtholder William V. like Wybo Fijnje and Gerrit Paape. Fijnje was one of the editors of the so-called Leiden Draft, a Patriot manifesto that appeared in 1785, and Cerisier may have had some input in its composition, though it is an exaggeration that he actually wrote the entire document.See for the claim and the controversy Jeremy Popkin, Dutch Patriots, French Journalists and Declaration of Rights: the leidse ontwerp of 1785 and its Diffusion in France, The Historical Journal, vol. 38 (1995): pp. 553-65; but Popkin later acknowledged that Cerisiers role was less important in the writing of the Leiden Draft; Cf. Jeremy D. Popkin, Antoine-Marie Cerisier; le Leidse Ontwerp et le Grondwettige Herstelling un debat encore ouvert in: De Achttiende Eeuw, vol. 29, no. 1 (1997), pp. 17-34. See also Jourdan, A., The \\"Alien Origins\\" of the French Revolution: American, Scottish, Genevan, and Dutch Influences, in: J. of the Western Society for French History, vol. 35 (2007, and Postma, J., Het Leids ontwerp. Mythen en Feiten, in: Openbaar Bestuur, vol. 18, no. 11 (November 2008), pp. 38‚Äì40 It is true, however, that he published a French extract of the Leiden Draft in 1788, after he had returned to France when the Patriot Revolution had been suppressed by Anglo- Prussian military intervention in the Fall of 1787, and many Patriots fled to France. This extract was entitled Extrait du plan g√©n√©ral de r√©forme concert√© par les patriotes hollandois and appeared in the periodical Analyse des papiers anglais. In this period Cerisier closely collaborated with the trailblazer of the French Revolution, Honor√© de Mirabeau, and Jeremy Popkin and others have speculated on the basis of archival research that this co- writer of the D√©claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen was influenced by this extract of the Dutch document.Popkin Cersisier was elected a representative for the Third Estate to the Estates General of 1789 for Bourg- en-Bresse, but he did not take his seat.Favre Instead he became an editor for the Gazette universelle, a royalist newspaper which he founded together with Joseph Fran√ßois Michaud and Pascal Boyer in 1789. This journal was financially very successful, but it was suppressed in 1792 when it published the fact that the Jacobin Jean Louis Carra had formerly been sentenced to the galleys.Van der Aa, p. 296 The periodical was then taken over by the government on 15 August 1792 and renamed Nouvelles politiques, nationales et √©trang√®res.Cf.Gazette universelle (1789-1792) Cerisier had to flee for his life to the Beaujolais where he was arrested and imprisoned under the Reign of Terror. He was released on 9 January 1794 (so before the fall of Maximilien Robespierre on 9 Thermidor).Favre Apparently, after this experience he decided to leave journalism and become a farmer. Not without success, because in 1807 (when his daughter Marie Sebastienne married) he appears to have been a successful businessman worth 200,000 francs. He became deputy mayor of the municipality of Lanci√© in 1800. In 1812 he became mayor, which he remained until after the Hundred Days. He resigned in 1816, but remained a member of the municipal council until 26 March 1827. He died in his native town Ch√¢tillon-l√®s-Dombes on 1 July 1828.Favre ==Works== *Tableau de l'histoire g√©n√©rale des Provinces Unies.

Towards the end of April Antonio Grumello, Cronaca, Lib.10, cap.15 Naples' governor Hugo of Moncada was killed by two arquebusiers and thrown into the sea during an unsuccessful attempt to break through the naval blockade and reach the Gulf of Salerno. During the battle Alfonso III d'Avalos was captured - he played a decisive part in the later negotiations for Doria's defection. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor appointed Philibert of Chalon Moncada's replacement as governor. On 22 May Orazio di Giampaolo Baglioni and his Black Bands were ambushed by a squad of Landsknechts near the river Sebeto, with Baglioni killed by a pike thrust. On 4 July Doria lifted the naval blockade after Genoa switched allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire in exchange for the liberation and subjugation of Savoy Francesco Guicciardini, Storia d'Italia , libro XIX, cap. 4. In summer 1528, de Foix destroyed the Bolla Aqueduct to try to starve out Naples' garrison. However, this turned the surrounding areas into marshes which combined with the summer heat to cause a fatal epidemic among the French forces. Many died, including de Foix himself on 15 August, passing command of the French force to Louis, Count of Vaud√©mont, who also died of illness a few days later Antonio Grumello, Cronaca, Lib.10, cap.17, passing the command this time to marquis Michele Antonio di Saluzzo.

He also served as the library‚Äôs first president and founded the Missouri Institute for the Education of the Blind after being inspired by teacher Eli W. Whelan. With Dr. William Greenleaf Eliot he founded Washington University in St. Louis in 1853. He was also a founder and president of the St. Louis Philharmonic Society, founded the Provident Association organize St. Louis charities and was a founder of the Western Sanitary Commission. In 1872 Yeatman donated property to the Catholic Church for an orphanage to serve those left behind after a cholera epidemic. The Christian Brothers began operating the orphanage in 1876 and it eventually became the La Salle Institute. Yeatman was also involved in advocating for and running a railroad, Pacific Railroad (which became Missouri Pacific Railroad). Yeatman met with Abraham Lincoln in Washington D.C. to helo counsel his dealings with Nebraska and Nathaniel Lyon. Yeatman served on the first board of the St. Louis Children‚Äôs Hospital and of Bellefontaine Cemetery. He died in 1901 and is buried there. The American writer Winston Churchill based a character in one of his novel The Crisis on Yeatman. Yeatman married twice and had five children. He was given the nickname Old Sanitary for his work in the field helping soldiers for the Western Sanitary Commission. ==References== Category:American bankers Category:American philanthropists Category:People from Missouri Category:1818 births Category:1901 deaths Category:People from Bedford County, Tennessee Category:19th-century philanthropists ","title":"James E.

When intercepted by the British, this raw intelligence required decryption, translation and confirmation and then was still just part of the overall case made for US entry into the conflict. Raw intelligence is raw data gathered by an intelligence operation, such as espionage or signal interception. Such data commonly requires processing and analysis to make it useful and reliable. To turn the raw intelligence into a finished form, the steps required may include decryption, translation, collation, evaluation and confirmation. In the period after the First World War, British practise was to circulate raw intelligence with little analysis or context. Such direct intelligence was a strong influence on policy-makers. Churchill was especially keen to see raw intelligence and was supplied this by Desmond Morton during his period outside the government. When Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he still insisted on receiving raw intelligence and wanted it all until it was explained that the volume was now too great. A selection of daily intercepts was provided to him each day by Bletchley Park and he called these his \\"golden eggs\\". US intelligence has a different tradition from the British. The key event for the US was the failure to prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor and the inquiries which followed concluded that this was not due to the lack of raw intelligence so much as the failure to make effective use of it. The Central Intelligence Agency was created to collate, analyse and summarise the raw intelligence collected by the other departments. US agencies which focus on the collection of raw intelligence include the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency. ==See also== * Source (intelligence) ==References== Category:Data Category:Intelligence assessment Category:Law enforcement terminology ","title":"Raw intelligence"},{"id":"56688189","text":"W.

It was designed by the famous engineer Kalman Kando and was built in the CEMSA plant. Ten locomotives were ordered but the project was terminated prematurely and only one locomotive was completed. The early termination of the project caused severe economic difficulties for CEMSA so the company welcomed an order for four locomotives from FAV. It has been suggested that one of the FAV locomotives was a rebuild of E.471 but this seems unlikely because E.471 was a large 1'D1' machine while the FAV locomotives were relatively small D types. What is more likely is that some parts manufactured for the cancelled FS order were used in the construction of the FAV locomotives. The first three units, E.440.1-2-3 were delivered in 1932 but the fourth, E.440.4, had to be built by Officine Meccaniche (OM) and Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB) following the economic difficulties of CEMSA. The locomotives served on the line between Sondrio and Tirano until 1967, when they were withdrawn and replaced by diesel-powered trains. ==Technical details== The E.440 locomotives were the only three-phase Italian machines to have the \\"D\\" wheel arrangement. Current collection was by trolley poles with dual spades. There was a single asynchronous motor of 1,000 kW (1 hour rating). The motion was transmitted to the wheels by articulated connecting rods using the Kando system with an idle jackshaft. Two fixed speeds of 33 and 50 km/h were available by pole-changing (Kando-Blathy system). The locomotive had a rigid frame and the axle at the cab end had side play of 40mm. The livery was black. ==Preservation== By the 1980s, three units had been scrapped. E.440.3, restored in the workshops at Tirano, was sent to the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa where it is exhibited. ==References== ==Further reading== * Erminio Mascherpa, E.471, Locomotive di sogno, Rovereto, Editore Nicolodi, 2005, * Sergio Vigan√≤, Alta Valtellina ieri ed oggi(in i treni 167/1996), pp 32-38, Sal√≤, ETR Category:D locomotives Category:Three-phase AC locomotives Category:Electric locomotives of Italy Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy Category:CEMSA locomotives ","title":"FAV Class E.440"},{"id":"56688193","text":"Aulacophora artensis is a species of leaf beetle in the genus Aulacophora. ==References== Category:Aulacophora Category:Beetles described in 1861 ","title":"Aulacophora artensis"},{"id":"56688201","text":"Aulacophora aruensis is a species of leaf beetle in the genus Aulacophora. ==References== Category:Aulacophora Category:Beetles described in 1892 ","title":"Aulacophora aruensis"},{"id":"56688213","text":"Divoselo () is a village in the Gospiƒá municipality in the Lika region of central Croatia.

A Puritan who was part of the Great Migration from England to New England, Phillips was a contemporary of, and often shared differing views with, John Winthrop. He established the first Congregational Church in Watertown and was one of the early influencers of the Congregational Church in North America. His descendants number in the thousands and are well represented in American history in the clergy, local and national politics, business, and social justice arenas. == Background and early life == Phillips was the son of Christopher Phillips of Raynham in the district of Gallow in Norfolk, England. He earned a B.A. from Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge in 1613, and subsequently earned an M.A. degree in 1617. By 1630 Phillips was the village vicar of Boxted, Essex and was increasingly dissatisfied, as were many Puritans, with the continuance of Roman Catholic ritual and insufficient Calvinist influences on the Church of England. He and many of his parishioners chose to leave England and head for America. Phillips joined John Winthrop on the Winthrop Fleet to emigrate to America on the Arbella, whose passengers included Winthrop and his family, Anne Bradstreet, Captain John Underhill, Thomas Dudley, and Richard Saltonstall.

New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2012 == Founding of Watertown and First Congregational Church == Phillips arrived with Saltonstall at what is now known as Gerry's Landing in what was initially known as the Saltonstall Plantation, in the summer of 1630. He called the first church together in July, and in late August he had 30 acres along the Charles River. It is claimed that Phillips was the author of the Watertown Covenant signed by the founders of the town, which not only served as an organizing document but also as a declaration of a bill of rights whose authority comes from \\"God\\": \\"We ... have undertaken (for the promoting of His glory, and the Church's good, and the honour of our blessed Jesus...) a long and hazardous voyage from‚Ä¶ Old England in Europe, to New England in America; that we may walk before Him, and serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our lives ... and enter into a sure covenant with the Lord our God, and before Him, with one another, by oath... to renounce all idolatry and superstition, will-worship, all human traditions and inventions whatsoever in the worship of God; and forsaking all evil ways, do give ourselves wholly unto the Lord Jesus, to do Him faithful service, observing and keeping all His statutes, commands, and ordinances, in all matters concerning our reformation, His worship, administrations, ministry, and government, and in the carriage for ourselves among ourselves and one towards another, as He hath prescribed in His holy Word.Further swearing to cleave unto that [the Word of God] alone, and the true sense and meaning thereof to the utmost of our power, as unto the most clear light, and infallible rule, and all-sufficient canon in all things that concern us in this our way.Redeemer Presbyterian Church:Our Heritage Accessed February 25, 2018Annals of an Ancient Parish. New England Magazine, Volume 12, pages 237-240 While Phillips was a Puritan, he expressed a greater tolerance and acceptance for differing Protestant thought. While critical of the Church of England, he was not an advocate of full separation. In fact, he signed a document entitled The Humble Request on the Arbella, explicitly denouncing a desire for separation.Thompson, Roger. Divided We Stand: Watertown, Massachusetts, 1630-1680. Univ. Mass. Press, 2001, page 65 He was a supporter of Infant baptism and was tolerant of Baptist religious views, much to the consternation of John Winthrop.

He began his studies at the College of Saint Anthony the Great (Col√©gio de Santo Ant√£o), a Jesuit college in Lisbon. He received his doctorate in Canon Law at the University of Coimbra. In his religious career, he passed the Holy Office as a deputy, and was an inquisitor in Lisbon. He was Bishop of Portalegre (1615-1618), and of Porto (1618-1626); was Archbishop of Braga (1626-1634) and Lisbon (1635-1642). He authored the reform of the Brevi√°rio Bracarense in 1634, and presided over the Lisbon Synod of 1640. D. Rodrigo da Cunha was one of the main opponents of the incorporation of Portugal in Spain, a policy followed by Philip IV of Spain. In 1638, he was even invited to become a cardinal in Madrid, refusing the offer. During the Portuguese Restoration War, he supported the revolutionaries and, together with the Archbishop of Braga, ruled the kingdom until the return of Jo√£o IV.

Tilquin is the only lambic blendery in the mainly French-speaking, southern region of Wallonia. Tilquin also is exclusively the only blendery that is allowed to blend of one, two, and three-year-old lambics with wort acquired from Boon, Lindemans, Girardin, and Cantillon breweries.http://www.gueuzerietilquin.be/en/overview/history/ == History== The brewery was founded in 2009 by Pierre Tilquin, a bio-engineer and holder of a PhD in statistical genetics. Prior to opening the blendery, he studied brewing science in Leuven, apprenticed at some of the major breweries in Belgium, including Huyghe Brewery, 3 Fonteinen and Cantillon.https://uproxx.com/life/best-sour-beer-craft/2/ Tilquin produces blends of one, two, and three-year-old lambics with wort acquired from Boon, Lindemans, Girardin, and Cantillon for the Oude Gueuze Tilquin √† L'Ancienne. While the first 2010-2011 labeled release of Oude Gueuze was reportedly a blend of just one and two-year-old lambics, all subsequent batches have been blends of one, two, and three-year-old lambics. The first known bottling of the gueuze occurred in December 2010 and was labelled as \\"1ier soutirage\\" (\\"1st racking).

The initial batch was limited to purchases at the brewery, but a second batch produced in January 2013 saw widespread release in Europe and North America later the same year. It was debuted to coincide with the 2013 Toer de Geuze. In 2012, Gueuzerie Tilquin joined HORAL, the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers. Tilquin is the first HORAL member outside of Flanders and lies just 200 meters past the language border in the French-speaking municipality of Rebecq. In March 2015, the Belgian daily newspaper La Capitale reported that 75% of Gueuzerie Tilquin's production was reserved for export with 40% of that being sent solely to the United States. Tilquin also participated in the 10th Anniversary Toer de Geuze in 2015. The weekend also saw the release of Tilquin's second fruited lambic, Oude M√ªre Tilquin √† l'Ancienne, a lambic fruited with blackberries.

He became a soldier at an early age since the family fortune was only modest. He initially served the della Rovere family then Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. He left Urbino's service sometime after reaching his majority around 1510, returning to the della Rovere family in the form of pope Julius II. He served under Andrea Doria, who put him in command of the war against the Barbary pirates by the Papal States and their French allies. In 1519 Filippino won attention for his major contribution to the victory at the battle of Pianosa by attacking the pirate from the rear with two galleys just when all seemed lost. He confirmed his allegiance to Andrea by accompanying him in his flight from Genoa after it was sacked by the Spanish in 1522 - the pair took four galleys and sailed to Monaco to enter the service of Francis I of France. He probably took part with Andrea in his conspiracy against Luciano Grimaldi, the defence of Marseille from the sea in 1524, the supply chain down the Rhone, the lucky capture of Philibert of Chalon and the daring plan to spring Francis from captivity after the battle of Pavia. The pair entered pope Clement VII's service after Pavia - he was then an ally of France. Andrea left his eight galleys under his nephew's command in Civitavecchia while he went to Rome to discuss naval strategy with Clement. Filippino took two ships to Portofino to assist in holding off an attack by doge Antoniotto Adorno in September 1526, which was aimed at relieving the blockade of Genoa. When news of the Sack of Rome reached Andrea's fleet, it sailed from Liguria to Fiumicino to aid Clement - Filippino made a failed attempt to land a group of soldiers and spring the pope from his effective captivity in Castel Sant'Angelo. The fleet sailed back towards Genoa, with Clement unable to pay it. The contract between Andrea and Clement expired in August 1527 and the fleet switched back to French service, with Francis I making Andrea his supreme naval commander in the Mediterranean. The fleet sailed to Savoy to pick up marshal Lautrec and his troops for a new campaign against the Empire. Filippino was attacked on land and captured on 15 August, but Andrea's reaction was instantaneous, forcing Adorno to abandon Genoa on 19 August. Once freed, Filippino seems to have opened the gates of the city to his cousin and to Cesare Fregoso. In September Andrea and Filippino attacked Castello Aragonese on Sardinia, but they were hit by a storm as well as a stout defence and so Filippino was reassigned to occupy Sassari. Still under Andrea's orders, he then brought his cousin's seven galleys and Antonio's galleys into Livorno to repair over the winter. When the naval war resumed in spring 1528, Andrea was ordered to sail to assist Lautrec in the siege of Naples, but refused and instead sent Filippino with eight galleys. He anchored in the Gulf of Salerno, blockading the city and killing Naples' governor Hugo of Moncada when he attempted a breakout by sea on 28 April. Both he and Andrea then went over to the Empire in June-August 1528, returning to free Naples from the French and then arriving off Genoa on 10 September. That night, Filippino led one of two landing parties which stormed the city shouting \\"St George and liberty!\\", capturing the town hall and city gate. He then starved out the garrison in the Castelletto fortress and captured Savoy. In 1529 Andrea made him captain general and the doge made him gonfalone of the Republic of Venice. He helped save Andrea from the Fieschi conspiracy in 1547, leading a band of 2,000 men with Agostino Spinola to defeat the last rebel stronghold at Montoggio. He predeceased Andrea sometime between 1548 and 1558. ==References== category:1470s births category:1550s deaths category:Military leaders of the Italian Wars category:Italian mercenaries ","title":"Filippino Doria"},{"id":"56688515","text":"Merzbach is a surname.

DoggoLingo, also referred to as doggotalk, woof, bork, and dog-speak, is an Internet language that is created from word conversion, meme lexicon, and onomatopoeia. DoggoLingo is implied to be a dog's own idiom, and is presented as what humans have long believed goes on in the canine brain. Elyse Graham, assistant professor at Stony Brook University, describes DoggoLingo as \\"upbeat, joyful, and clueless in a relentlessly friendly way\\". == Structure == DoggoLingo appends various diminutive suffixes \\"-o\\", \\"-er\\", \\"-ino\\" to existing English words (e.g. dog turns into doggo, pup turns into pupper) as well as DoggoLingo words that have been created (e.g. pupper turns into pupperino, bork turns into borker). DoggoLingo relies heavily upon onomatopoeia: Words such as blep, blop and mlem describe the action of a dog sticking out its tongue; bork, boof, woof describe the various canine barking sounds. A dog with a fluffy coat may be called a floof or a fluff. DoggoLingo follows a similar rudimentary style to create its verbs (e.g. doin me a in place of present participles, such as doin me a scare \\"scaring me\\") and adjectives (e.g. heckin in place of degree modifiers such as extremely). 'Heck' is frequently used in place of more conventional expletives. Some words also come from eye dialect spellings of English words, such as fren \\"friend\\". == Origin == The exact origin of DoggoLingo is unknown. Various social media accounts such as WeRateDogs (Twitter), Dogspotting (Facebook), as well as social news aggregation and imageboard websites like 4chan, Reddit, or Tumblr have aided in popularizing the use of DoggoLingo by consistently using or hosting content that uses the lingo on their Internet pages. In 2014, the Dogspotting Facebook account gained popularity, especially in Australia where coincidentally adding \\"-o\\" to the end of words is also a feature of Australian slang. == Other animals == Some other animals are referred to differently in DoggoLingo: One would refer to a snake as snek or danger noodle, a human being as hooman, a cat as catto (cf. doggo), etc. Internet fan groups for other animals have adopted many of the conventions of DoggoLingo for their own related languages for their preferred animals (like Posso or Poss-speak for opossums). Lolcats may be a precursor to DoggoLingo. Many aspects of DoggoLingo have also been adopted into the language and terminology of the furry fandom, called ‚Äúfurspeech‚Äù. == References == Category:Internet memes Category:Internet slang ","title":"DoggoLingo"},{"id":"56688659","text":"Adam Skumawitz (born 1979) is an American businessman, soccer coach, and former professional player who played for Aalesunds FK in the Eliteserien in 2003. ==Career== Skumawitz currently lives in southern California and is the Vice President of Anselmo Investment Management .

Theater director and writer Isaac Butler and journalist Dan Kois co-authored the history based upon interviews conducted in 2016‚Äì2017 with people involved with the play in different ways. The oral history was originally compiled by the authors for the 2016 Slate cover story \\"Angels in America: The Complete Oral History\\". The release of the book commemorated the 25th anniversary of the play's Broadway theatre premiere in 1993. ==Overview== The oral history draws from around 250 interviews with people directly and indirectly involved with Angels in America, ranging from its playwright Tony Kushner to former Congressman Barney Frank. Quotes from these interviews are combined with relevant selections from the play, contemporary press coverage, and photos to tell the story of the play, its context, and its impact. The book begins by setting the social and political context for the work, exploring how such events as the 1978 assassination of Harvey Milk and the beginnings of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s influenced and inspired Kushner's writing of the play. It then follows the writing, development, and initial production history of the play, examining how it went from a small theater in San Francisco to winning the Tony Award for Best Play during its Broadway run. The social and political impacts of the play are also explored, as well as its legacy in the theater world and its continued importance and relevance as a work of art. The book also covers how subsequent productions of the play, such as those in politically conservative areas, came to be and how their audiences and communities reacted to them. ==Reviews== Steven Winn, writing for SFGate, praised the authors' ability to capture the lasting significance of Angels in America and to vividly depict what goes into great theater, but noted that the amount of detail included in the book was sometimes overwhelming. Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post described the history as a \\"vital book about how to make political art that offers lasting solace in times of great trouble, and wisdom to audiences in the years that follow.\\" ==Release details== ==References== Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:Oral history books Category:Books about LGBT history Category:Non-fiction books about theatre Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books Category:American history books ","title":"The World Only Spins Forward"},{"id":"56688803","text":"Jacobabad may refer to: *Jacobabad, a city situated in Pakistan. *Jacobabad District, an administrative unit of Sindh, Pakistan *Jacobabad Taluka, a tehsil of Jacobabad District. *Jacobabad Air Base, an airbase in Pakistan. ==Transportation== *Jacobabad Junction railway station, a railway station in Pakistan. ==See also== * * Category:Place name disambiguation pages ","title":"Jacobabad (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56688808","text":"Claudia Alvera (born 6 July 1966) is an Italian curler. ==Personal Life== Alvera works as a chef.

It is the innermost of three Super-Earths around the star K2-148, which is in a wide binary pair with the M0.5V red dwarf EPIC 220194953. K2-148b is the smallest planet of the system, at about a third larger than Earth, and could be terrestrial in nature. However, the three planets do not exhibit significant transit timing variations, implying that they could have relatively low masses. The planet was validated in early 2018 by Hirano et al. and is too hot for known life. ==Characteristics== ===Mass, radius, and temperature=== K2-148b is a Super-Earth, meaning that it is larger than Earth but smaller than the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Because it was detected with the transit method, only the radius of the planet is known. It is 1.33 , about a third larger than Earth. A planet of this size is likely rocky, and with an Earth-like composition, K2-148b would have a mass of about 2.5 . Since K2-148b is in a multiple planet system, transit timing variations could be used to determine the masses of the planets by seeing how the planets pull on each other and slightly change when they transit the star. However, the TTVs of the K2-148 system were quite low, which may mean that K2-148b is not rocky. The planet is quite hot due to its proximity to its host star, with an equilibrium temperature of , far too high for liquid water to exist on its surface.PHL's calculators It receives about 48 times more sunlight than Earth gets from the Sun. ===Orbit=== K2-148b has a tight orbit around its host star. It only takes about 4.4 Earth days for the planet to complete one full orbit around its star, with a semi-major axis of 0.0454 AU. For comparison, the innermost planet in our Solar System, Mercury, takes 88 days to orbit at a distance of 0.38 AU. The eccentricity and inclination of K2-148b's orbit are currently unknown. ===Host star=== K2-148b orbits a late-K dwarf star known as K2-148, or EPIC 220194974. It is 63% the radius, 65% the mass, and 10% the luminosity of the Sun, with a temperature of 4079 K and an unknown age. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old. It is orbited by a slightly smaller M0.5V red dwarf known as EPIC 220194953 at a distance of 1,100 AU. The companion star is about 58% the radius, 60% the mass, and 6.6% as luminous as the Sun with a temperature of 3854 K. EPIC 220194953 is slightly more metal-rich than K2-148, and the two are confirmed to be gravitationally bound to each other. ==See also== *Kepler-296e and Kepler-296f, two Super-Earths orbiting a red dwarf in a wide binary system.

It is common to sea grass prairies and coral formations. The species was initially discovered in an octopus fishery in Campeche Mexico, where its close external resemblance to Octopus vulgaris led to its mistaken grouping with the other species.Voss, Gilbert L., and Manuel Sol√≠s Ram√≠rez. \\"Octopus maya, a new species from the Bay of Campeche, Mexico.\\" Bulletin of Marine Science 16.3 (1966): 615-625. O. maya makes up 80% of octopus catch in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, while O. vulgaris makes up the remaining 20%. Octopus maya can be identified by its large, double-ringed ocellus (a false eye spot) and large egg size (averaging 17mm). The mantle is muscular, large, and oval in shape. There is some variation in the definite shape of the posterior end of the mantle, but all are fairly narrow and meet the head at a characteristically narrow neck. Females grow to be larger than males, weighing in at 1024g with mantles measuring 124mm. Males grow to be about 484g with mantles 91mm long.Markaida, Unai, et al. ‚ÄúSeasonal and Spatial Trends of Mayan Octopus, Octopus Maya, Population Dynamics from Campeche, Mexico.‚Äù Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, vol. 97, no. 8, 2017, pp. 1663‚Äì1673., doi:10.1017/S0025315416001132. They are usually dark brown in color but may turn red when agitated. They are also able to mimic the color of the sand on the seafloor. The ocellus is a dark red brown and found directly beneath the eye between the second and third arm. It has been found in depths between 3 and 25m along the continental shelf of the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Pech- Puch, Dawrin, et al. \\"Chemical tools of Octopus maya during crab predation are also active on conspecifics.\\" PLOS One 11.2 (2016): e0148922. ==Habitat== Campeche Bank is located off of the Yucat√°n Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. It extends about 125 miles into the Gulf where it suddenly drops off, ending it the Alacran Reef. There are very low levels of sediments along the Bank between the shore and the reef. The benthic environment in this region can be characterized by fine carbonate sand. The strong currents the flow westward along the bank year round likely contribute to the nature of the benthic sand and lack of sediments.Folk, Robert L, and Rogelio Robles. ‚ÄúCarbonate Sands of Isla Perez, Alacran Reef Complex, Yucat√°n.‚Äù The Journal of Geology, vol. 72, no. 3, 1964, pp. 255‚Äì292. ==Diet== Octopus maya is known to feed primarily on benthic prey such as crustaceans, bivalves, fish, gastropods, other octopuses, and even birds. Two specific prey items that O. maya commonly feeds on are blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and the crown conch snail (Melongena corona bispinosa). Neurotoxins in O. maya‚Äôs saliva cause temporary paralysis in its prey, allowing for easier consumption. This paralytic also works on conspecifics, leading researchers to believe that it is used in territorial defense as well as intraspecific competition. Beyond the chemicals found in their saliva, not much is known about hunting techniques specific to O. maya. However, looking at sister taxa, including the closely related Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris), can shed some light on likely mechanisms used by O. maya. O vulgaris has been observed using its strong suckers to restrain its prey, while carrying the victim toward its mouth. The octopus can then inject the organism with saliva, drilling holes into the bodies of shelled organisms such as crabs and bivalves using its beak as necessary, and consume its prey. ==Lifespan and reproduction== Octopus maya is semelparous, meaning that females die following a single round of reproduction. Males are able to reproduce multiple times during their reproductive phase, but only survive for a single spawning season. This period of activity during which males actively search for a mate makes them much more vulnerable to predators.Hern√°ndez- Garcƒ±a, V., J. L. Hern√°ndez-L√≥pez, and J. J. Castro-Hdez. \\"On the reproduction of Octopus vulgaris off the coast of the Canary Islands.\\" Fisheries Research 57.2 (2002): 197-203. The male will fertilize the female‚Äôs eggs internally, then the female will carry them within her body for between 14 and 50 days until spawning. The spawning process lasts approximately 5 days, during which the female will deposit her eggs in a den for incubation.Rosas C., Gallardo P., Mascar√≥ M., Caamal-Monsreal C., Pascual C. (2014) Octopus maya. In: Iglesias J., Fuentes L., Villanueva R. (eds) Cephalopod Culture. Springer, Dordrecht The female blows jets of water over the strands of eggs to keep them clean and ventilated, as well as providing protection to them until hatching. During this period, the female will not leave the eggs to eat, resulting in her death shortly after her offspring hatch. The incubation period for O. maya typically lasts between 30 and 35 days, although there may be individual variation. ==Conservation and climate change== Octopus maya is sensitive to temperatures exceeding 27 degrees Celsius. As increased temperatures it suffers a decrease in fitness and reproductive capabilities. Thus, rising ocean temperatures pose a serious threat to this species. Continued fishing of this octopus along with dwindling populations could quickly become serious as the processes of climate change causes continued rise in ocean temperaturesJu√°rez, Oscar E., et al. \\"Is temperature conditioning Octopus maya fitness?.\\" Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 467 (2015): 71-76.\\\\ == References == Category:Octopodidae Category:Molluscs described in 1966 ","title":"Octopus maya"},{"id":"56689085","text":"The West Coast Sentinel is a weekly newspaper published Thursdays in Ceduna, South Australia.

During his life, he taught about 120 people how to play kanklƒós and established several ensembles, one of which is still active. He laid the groundwork for kanklƒós education and adapted numerous folk and professional songs to the instrument, but did not attempt to modify its design. ==Early life== Puskunigis was born on 16 July 1860 in the village near Sintautai, August√≥w Governorate, Congress Poland. His father was well respected in the community and acted as a priest in an emergency. Therefore, it is said that his nickname puskunigis (literally: half-priest) became the surname of his children. After three years at the Sintautai primary school, Puskunigis attended the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. But his mother's death forced him to abandon studies and return to farming. He learned to play kanklƒós from his uncle, got introduced to a violin and clarinet in Veiveriai. In 1882, he moved to Kaunas where he worked at various churches and learned to play piano and organ. For a time he lived in the United States, but returned in 1905 and settled in near Veiveriai. He had a small farm of , but devoted his time and energy to music. He once again became a church organist and organized an ensemble of kanklƒós players, mostly from the students at the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. Its first performance was in 1906 at the nearby Sasnava. This ensemble, known simply as Kanklƒós since 1984, continues to this day. Puskunigis manufactured numerous kanklƒós that had 11 or 12 strings. ==World War I and after== During World War I, Saliamonas Banaitis invited Puskunigis to establish an ensemble of kanklƒós players at his printing press in Kaunas. The ensemble began giving performances in late 1915. Accompanied by a student choir from the Saulƒó Gymnasium (led by Banaitis' son and future composer ), the ensemble organized a concert at the Kaunas City Theater on 5 January 1916. The ensemble also performed at a fair in K√∂nigsberg. In 1922, Puskinigis was invited by General to organize an ensemble that would perform during the official state ceremonies at the Kaunas War Museum. He gathered a group of veterans of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and experienced players from Skriaud≈æiai which debuted in May 1923 but due to conflicts the project was soon abandoned. Puskunigis was then invited by a school in ≈†anƒçiai where he trained about 60 students. The school ensemble debuted at the Vytautas' the Great Church during the first Lithuanian Song Festival in 1924 and recorded several songs with the operatic tenor Kipras Petrauskas. In June 1925, Puskunigis was one of the founders of the Kanklƒós Players' Society, chaired by and . The same year Puskunigis was interviewed by Armas Otto V√§is√§nen, the Finnish scholar of folk music. In 1925‚Äì1926, Puskunigis petitioned the Lithuanian government for a permit and funding to open Kanklƒós Musical School three times. The permit was finally received in 1930 and he became a teacher. Lithuanian composers, such as Juozas Naujalis and Juozas Gruodis, considered kanklƒós to be an obsolete instrument and did not support the efforts of Puskunigis. At the same time, Puskunigis protested efforts to improve and modernize kanklƒós. Therefore, he soon retired from the musical school and spent remainder of his life in Skriaud≈æiai. He spent the time correcting and organizing his writings ‚Äì note sheets, original and translated articles, songs, poems. His son counted 48 songs created by Puskunigis. His most successful songs are (The Anthem of Kanklƒós Players) and (A Song about the Past). His textbook on kanklƒós was published in 1932. In 1937, he recorded 34 songs. He died in 1946 in Skriaud≈æiai. His home in Skriaud≈æiai was turned into a museum of the 19th- century lifestyle in 1987. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Lithuanian folk musicians Category:Lithuanian organists Category:Male organists ","title":"Pranas Puskunigis"},{"id":"56689487","text":"Shazia Kamran (; born 8 March 1969) is a Pakistani politician who was a Member of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, from May 2013 to May 2018. ==Early life and education== She was born on 8 March 1969 in Sahiwal.

There is some debate as to whether the kokanee and its sea-going relative are separate species; geographic isolation, failure to interbreed, and genetic distinction point toward a recent divergence in the history of the two groups. The divergence most likely occurred around 15,000 years ago when a large ice melt created a series of freshwater lakes and rivers across the northern part of North America. While some members of the salmon family (salmonids) went out to sea (anadromous), others stayed behind in fresh water (non-anadromous).Cheng, Heng. \\"From Lakes to Oceans: Speciation of Sockeye Salmon and Other Fishes.\\" Emory Scholars Blog. Emory University. April 30, 2014. Accessed February 14, 2018. The separation of the sockeye and the kokanee created a unique example of sympatric speciation that is relatively new in evolutionary terms. While they occupy the same areas and habitats during the breeding season, when ocean-going sockeye salmon return to freshwater to spawn, the two populations do not mate with each other in some regions, suggesting speciation. ==Distribution== The kokanee species can be found in the northern United States of Alaska, Washington, Idaho, California, Oregon, and Utah. It can also be found up through British Columbia and the Yukon in Canada. Subdivisions of the kokanee are found in Japan and Russia. The kokanee was introduced to several other states, including New England, New York, Montana, North Dakota, California, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. It was also introduced to parts of Canada. ==Genetic and morphological diversity== There is debate as to whether the kokanee has enough genetic distinction to be classified as a subspecies or a separate species from the sockeye salmon. Genetic evidence suggests that the evolution of landlocked sockeye has occurred more than once with different kokanee populations, showing genetic differences between populations. Most evidence points to events that land-locked the lake-type sockeye (which spawns in streams and lakes, rather than tributaries like the sea-type sockeye, but is still anadromous and spends most of its adult life out at sea), which evolved into the non-anadromous form. Genetic evidence from kokanee in the Fraser River drainage and Columbia River drainage shows that ancestors of the kokanee came from the lake-type sockeye. The data also suggests that the kokanee may have evolved back into a lake-type anadromous form at some point in recent history, although there is a lack of interbreeding between it and sockeye in the drainage systems. It is also important to note that genetic distinction between sockeye and kokanee that cohabitate varies from region to region, with some populations showing distinct divergence, but others showing very little divergence. Studies done in Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and Lake Sammamish in Washington State suggested that the genetic diversity between the lake-type sockeye and the kokanee marks the divergence of two species because cohabitating sockeye and kokanee did not interbreed, despite the fact that interbreeding was possible. There is some morphological divergence between the kokanee and sockeye. The most noticeable difference is size. The kokanee is often smaller than the sockeye due to less nutrient availability in freshwater . Other morphological differences include higher gill raker counts in the kokanee, failure to develop the changes that allow the sockeye to transition between fresh and salt water, and juvenile kokanee's lower mean swim velocity compared to juvenile sockeye . Egg sizes are also a difference. Due to its size, the kokanee should theoretically have smaller eggs in order to increase fecundity. In reality, the kokanee egg size varies, even though the energetic cost of larger eggs can limit the fecundity of kokanee populations. Studies have found that kokanees can extract carotenoids (which provide red pigmentation during breeding) ( note well that it's the same carotenoids that flamingos eat to pinken their feathers) from food better than sockeyes due to sexual selection and mate choice. Again, the degree of morphological variation, such as gill raker count, can vary from population to population. The Japanese kokanee, also known as the kunimasu salmon or black kokanee, is considered a subspecies of the sockeye salmon by some and occurs naturally in Lakes Akan and Chimikeppu on Hokkaido Island. The creation of a dam caused the extermination of the fish by changing the lake pH. As a result, the kokanee was believed to have gone extinct in the 1940s. In 2011 a few fish were found in an isolated lake on Mount Fuji. The Japanese kokanee varies from its sea- going sockeye relative in a few ways. The black kokanee breeds in March at a depth of 30‚Äì40 feet, while sockeye salmon breed in the fall and have a different number of gill rakers than the kokanee. In addition, the black kokanee is much darker in color than the sockeye or any other kokanee population. The fish has been introduced to different lakes around Japan for commercial fishing practices. It seems that commercial captive breeding programs, the introduction of non-native kokanee populations from Canada, and a population crash have decreased the genetic distinctiveness between the black kokanee and its sockeye relatives. These factors have also caused a decrease in native kokanee populations. ==Identification, life cycle, and development== While size range of kokanee is often lake-specific and depends on many factors, in typical populations the kokanee grows to an average size of with an average weight of . In bodies of water with more favorable conditions it can reach a size of up to and weigh . The largest kokanee, caught in Washington State, weighed . Adult kokanee can be found in open water where the thermocline is around . They can have anywhere between 29‚Äì40 gill rakers. As a fish that inhabits freshwater throughout their lifecycle they are often smaller than their sea-going sockeye relatives, due to less food availability. Size is the most significant morphological distinction between the kokanee and the sockeye, but gill raker count can differ from sockeye salmon as well. The main food source of this fish is plankton. ‚ÄúKokanee have blue backs and silver sides and unlike other salmon and trout, except chum salmon, sockeye and kokanee lack distinct dark spots on their backs and tail fins. In addition, when compared to other trout, they have finer scales, larger eyes, and deeply forked tail‚Äù. The typical life cycle of the kokanee is similar to that of other salmon. They are born in a stream and migrate down to a lake where they will spend most of their adult lives. Kokanee typically live for four years in a lake before heading back to spawning grounds to spawn and die. However, population longevity can vary between 2‚Äì7 years. A kokanee can spawn in a variety of different time periods called runs. Individual populations can have multiple runs associated with the kokanee in a lake and occur from August to February. Some kokanee have been seen spawning in April. The female kokanee creates a nest called a redd. She will lay around 1,000 eggs, depending on food availability. Eggs hatch within 110 days, and the juveniles swim out to the lake. During spawning, the males turn bright red and develop a humped back and an elongated jaw similar to the male sockeye salmon. Females also don a dark red hue during the breeding season, which also corresponds with the breeding season of sockeye salmon. Competition with introduced lake trout can lead to a decline in kokanee populations during the summer. Lake trout are predatory and will eat young kokanee. Predation by lake trout accounted for 83 percent of the 88 percent decline in kokanee populations in Lake Chelan, Washington. Other factors such as pollution, habitat loss, and warming global temperatures put the kokanee at risk in some areas. ==Conservation== Some kokanee populations have declined in the US and Canada, while others thrive. The kokanee's status is variable among different locations under the Endangered Species Act. They are listed as Endangered in the Snake River in Idaho and threatened in Ozette Lake in Washington State. Other kokanee populations in Washington State have shown genetic distinction, but attempts by the Lake Sammamish Kokanee Work Group to get the Lake Sammamish kokanee listed as a separate species and therefore endangered failed the US Fish and Wildlife criteria to be listed as a distinct species. The current IUCN red list standing of the kokanee is listed under the sockeye salmon (Oncohynchus nerka) is of least concern.Rand, P.S. 2011. Oncorhynchus nerka. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2011: e.T135301A4071001. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2011-2.RLTS.T135301A4071001.en. Downloaded on 14 February 2018. Even so, King County Washington in partnership with US Fish and Wildlife has issued conservation measures to save the fish that once numbered in the thousands. As few as 150 fish spawned in 2007‚Äì2008 marking a critical need for conservation of the state's kokanee population. Currently, restoration of streams, habitats, hatchery breeding, and a ban on fishing for kokanee has caused an increase in native kokanee populations. Lakes in Canada have also seen a decline in native kokanee, with numbers dropping from 2,800 fish to just 88 fish in 2007 in the Kluane National Park and Reserve. The park has outlawed fishing of kokanee, and it is illegal to possess a kokanee salmon. Conservation efforts have been largely successful with 4,660 kokanee spawning in the park in 2015. It is unclear as to why the kokanee population crashed in the mid and late 2000s. == References == Category:Oncorhynchus Category:Fish of Canada Category:Freshwater fish of the United States Category:Freshwater fish of Japan Category:Fish of Russia Category:Freshwater fish of North America ","title":"Kokanee salmon"},{"id":"56689621","text":"Sunset Eyes 2000 is an album by trumpeter Saskia Laroo and saxophonist Teddy Edwards which was recorded in 1999 and released on the Laroo label.Saskia Laroo biography accessed February 23, 2018Teddy Edwards discography accessed February 23, 2018 ==Reception== In his review on Allmusic, Alex Henderson states \\"Sunset Eyes 2000 falls short of being a gem, but it's a satisfying, decent effort that bop fans will enjoy\\". == Track listing == All compositions by Teddy Edwards except where noted # \\"Nothin' But the Truth\\" ‚Äì 6:01 # \\"Moving In\\" ‚Äì 5:04 # \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" (Isham Jones, Marty Symes) ‚Äì 6:12 # \\"Sunset Eyes\\" ‚Äì 5:30 # \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" (Irving Berlin) ‚Äì 6:56 # \\"Don't Touch Me\\" ‚Äì 5:38 # \\"The Blue Sombrero\\" ‚Äì 4:56 # \\"I Got It Bad' (Duke Ellington, Paul Francis Webster) ‚Äì 3:43 # \\"Wheelin' and Dealin'\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Blue Bossa\\" (Kenny Dorham) ‚Äì 7:35 # \\"Sunset Eyes Latin\\" ‚Äì 4:40 == Personnel == *Saskia Laroo ‚Äì trumpet (tracks 1‚Äì7 & 9-11) *Teddy Edwards ‚Äì tenor saxophone (tracks 1, 2 & 4‚Äì11) *Ernie Andrews ‚Äì vocals (tracks 4, 6 & 11) *Art Hillery ‚Äì piano *Wendell Williams ‚Äì bass *Gerryck King ‚Äì drums == References == Category:Teddy Edwards albums Category:Saskia Laroo albums Category:1999 albums ","title":"Sunset Eyes 2000"},{"id":"56689637","text":"The Port Lincoln Times is a newspaper published twice-weekly in Port Lincoln, South Australia. It was first printed in August 1927, and has been published continuously ever since. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. ==History== The origins of the Port Lincoln Times began when the Recorder in Port Pirie was taken over by Mrs R.L. McGregor and her two sons. McGregor had worked under David Drysdale at the Port Augusta Dispatch and claims she was instrumental in suggesting that he start a newspaper in Port Lincoln. In 1925, she was approached by another former Dispatch employee, Maurice Hill, to sell the Recorder, but she refused, and as a result, Hill, along with J.E. Edwards, founded the Port Lincoln Times. The Port Lincoln Times was first published on 5 August 1927, and unlike many newspapers of the time, it did not continue or subsume a previous publication, and used a simple banner title without a definite article or sur- and sub-titles. On page 6 of the first issue, the new publication was introduced as both independent and non-sectarian, alongside an overall aim \\"to entertain and instruct by giving the whole of the news of the district which it serves, and to give it brightly, briefly, accurately and completely\\". It absorbed the West Coast Recorder in 1942 as a result of wartime consolidations. In 1960, it also absorbed the Areas Express (17 September 1959 - 8 September 1960), which had been printed in Cleve. Since its founding, the company has been situated on the same site on Washington Street, Port Lincoln, since 1927. By the 1960s, the Hill family had modernised the look of the paper (with large front-page headlines, sport action photographs and large advertisements), and in 1990 the newspaper was taken over by Rural Press. Alongside many other rural publications in Australia (e.g. Eyre Peninsula Tribune), the newspaper was a member of Fairfax Media Limited, a national company which has been purchasing and rationalising publication assets across the country. In addition, the newspaper also printed a short-lived free newspaper, the Eyre Peninsula Rural Chronicle (1987‚Äì1990), and a sister publication, the Peninsula Farmer, in conjunction with the West Coast Sentinel. ==West Coast Recorder== The West Coast Recorder began printing in 1904 as the Port Lincoln, Tumby and West Coast Recorder which was shortened to the West Coast Recorder in 1909. The Recorder, had absorbed the Streaky Bay Standard and West Coast Advertiser (1912), which was only issued twice by David Drysdale in early April that year, and quickly became a \\"Supplement to the West Coast recorder\\". It continued until it combined with the Port Lincoln Times in 1942. It was the first major newspaper established in Port Lincoln. The Port Lincoln History Group was raising funds in 2020 to work with the State Library of South Australia to digitise all editions of the newspaper and make them available on Trove. ==Distribution== The Port Lincoln Times is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays and is printed in Murray Bridge at the high-tech Rural Press printing centre. It serves the Lower Eyre Peninsula area, namely: Port Lincoln, Arno Bay, Cleve, Coffin Bay, Colton, Coomunga, Coulta, Cowell, Cummins, Darke Peak, Edillilie, Elliston, Karkoo, Kimba, Kyancutta, Lipson, Lock, Louth Bay, Mount Damper, Mount Hope, Mount Wedge, North Shields, Port Neill, Rudall, Sheringa, Talia, Tooligie, Tumby Bay, Ungarra, Wangary, Wanilla, Warramboo, Warrow, Wharminda, Wudinna, Yallunda Flat, and Yeelanna. The current monthly readership is estimated to be 19,000. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online. == Digitisation == Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1927 to 1954, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service. In 2020 the Port Lincoln History Group was raising funds to also digitise the West Coast Recorder. ==References== ==External links== * Port Lincoln Times website * SA Memory (40th Tunarama Festival) * Category:Newspapers published in South Australia Category:Publications established in 1927 ","title":"Port Lincoln Times"},{"id":"56689662","text":"Vic Clark is a retired American football coach.

She wrote books on set theory and category theory, and is known as one of the namesakes of the Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem in graph coloring. ==Education and career== Hasse was born in Warnem√ºnde. She went to the gymnasium in Rostock, and after a term in the Reich Labour Service from 1939 to 1940, studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Rostock and University of T√ºbingen from 1940 to 1943, earning a diploma in 1943 from Rostock. She continued at Rostock as an assistant and lecturer, earning a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1949 and a habilitation in 1954. Her doctoral dissertation, √úber eine singul√§re Intergralgleichung 1. Art mit logarithmischer Unstetigkeit [On a singular integral equation of the 1st kind with logarithmic discontinuity], was supervised by Hans Schubert; her habilitation thesis was √úber eine Hillsche Differentialgleichung [On Hill's differential equation]. She worked as a professor of algebra at TU Dresden from 1954 until her 1981 retirement. The Rostock CPR gives the date of her start at Dresden as 1964, but this would leave a ten-year gap in her work life, and Voss is clear that she arrived before the 1962 start of Lieselott Herforth. ==Contributions== With Lothar Michler, Hasse wrote Theorie der Kategorien [Category Theory] (Deutscher Verlag, 1966). She also wrote Grundbegriffe der Mengenlehre und Logik [Basic Concepts of Set Theory and Logic] (Harri Deutsch, 1968). In the theory of graph coloring, the Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem provides a duality between colorings of the vertices of a graph and orientations of its edges. It states that the minimum number of colors needed in a coloring equals the number of vertices in a longest path, in an orientation chosen to minimize the length of this path. It was stated in 1958 in a graph theory textbook by Claude Berge, and independently published by Hasse, Tibor Gallai, B. Roy, and L. Vitaver. Hasse's publication of this result was the second chronologically, in 1965. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2014 deaths Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:German women mathematicians Category:Graph theorists Category:Set theorists Category:Category theorists Category:University of Rostock alumni Category:TU Dresden faculty Category:21st-century German mathematicians ","title":"Maria Hasse"},{"id":"56689679","text":"Random Acts of Flyness is an American late-night sketch comedy television series created by Terence Nance that premiered on August 4, 2018 on HBO.

It was formed in 2017 as a spin-off from Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It owns 31 casinos, hotels, and racetracks and 4 golf courses throughout the United States. ==History== Vici Properties was formed as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (CEOC), the largest division of Caesars Entertainment. After placing CEOC into bankruptcy in January 2015, Caesars proposed splitting CEOC into two companies: a REIT, which would own the company's casinos, and an operating company, which would manage them. The plan was designed to maximize value for CEOC's creditors by taking advantage of favorable tax treatment for REITs. Several members of Congress opposed the plan, calling it an abuse of the REIT laws. They asked the Internal Revenue Service to deny tax-free status to the spin-off, but their protest went unheeded. The spin-off of Vici to CEOC's creditors was completed on October 6, 2017, the day that CEOC emerged from bankruptcy. Vici began with a portfolio of nineteen casinos and racetracks, all leased to Caesars at a total initial annual rent of $630 million, and four golf courses. The company's name was adopted from the phrase \\"Veni, vidi, vici,\\" commonly attributed to Julius Caesar. Vici acquired Harrah's Las Vegas from Caesars in December 2017 for $1.1 billion, and leased it back at an initial annual rent of $87.4 million. MGM Growth Properties, a REIT affiliated with Caesars competitor MGM Resorts International, offered in January 2018 to acquire Vici for an estimated $5.9 billion. Vici's board rejected the offer, deciding instead to proceed with a planned initial public offering. Vici completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2018, raising $1.2 billion. The company moved its headquarters to New York City from the Las Vegas area in mid-2018. Vici completed two transactions with Caesars in 2018, purchasing the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace for $508 million and Harrah's Philadelphia for $242 million, and leasing them back to Caesars for $35 million and $21 million per year, respectively. In 2019, Vici made two purchases in conjunction with Penn National Gaming. Vici bought the real estate of the Margaritaville Resort Casino in Louisiana and Greektown Casino‚ÄìHotel in Detroit for $261 million and $700 million, respectively, while Penn bought both properties' operating businesses and leased them from Vici for annual rent of $23 million and $56 million, respectively. Vici bought a second casino from Greektown seller Jack Entertainment, Jack Cincinnati Casino, in September 2019, paying $558 million for the real estate; Hard Rock International leased the property for $43 million per year. In December 2019, Vici bought three casinos in Missouri and West Virginia from Eldorado Resorts in conjunction with Century Casinos: Isle Casino Cape Girardeau, Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville, and Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort. Vici paid $278 million for the real estate assets, and leased them to Century for $25 million per year. A month later, the company bought two more properties from Jack Entertainment, Jack Cleveland Casino and Jack Thistledown Racino, for a total of $843 million, leasing them back for $66 million per year. In July 2020, Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment, becoming Vici's primary tenant, and renamed itself to Caesars Entertainment. In connection with this acquisition, Vici bought three properties (Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin, and Harrah's New Orleans) from Caesars for a total of $1.8 billion, and leased them back to the new Caesars for $154 million per year. ==Properties== ===Casinos, hotels, and racetracks=== The company owns the following casinos, hotels and racetracks.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Greg Nicotero. It is the final regular appearance of Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes, who had been on the show since the first season and in turn also marks the departure of actor Jayson Warner Smith (Gavin) who was part of the recurring cast since previous season, because his character is killed by Morgan Jones (Lennie James) and Henry (Macsen Lintz). ==Plot== Following Negan and the Saviors' assault on the communities of Alexandria and the Kingdom, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies deal with the aftermath of events. In a flashback, Carl (Chandler Riggs), having been bitten by a walker while trying to bring Siddiq (Avi Nash) to Alexandria, keeps his bite mark hidden, makes sure Siddiq finds quarters in the sewers below the community, spends time with his toddler sister Judith, and writes several letters to those he knew. In the Kingdom, Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith) and the other Saviors of his group keep watch over Ezekiel (Khary Payton). Outside the community, Carol (Melissa McBride) leads the Kingdom survivors far enough away and instructs them to continue towards the house she used outside of the Kingdom for shelter, while she goes back to rescue Ezekiel. Henry (Macsen Lintz), who is trained in both firearm and melee combat and whose older brother Benjamin had been killed by a Savior, insists that he come along to assist, but Carol orders him to stay with the others. Carol soon meets up with Morgan (Lennie James), who had escaped the Saviors' massacre of Rick's snipers watching the Sanctuary. However, Morgan has become bitter and once the two are inside, he becomes brutal in dispatching the Saviors. At one point during the mission, Morgan disembowels a Savior as Carol and a rescued Ezekiel watch. Gavin, the last Savior of the group left alive, flees and attempts to hide, but Morgan easily finds him. Morgan prepares to kill Gavin, but Carol senses that Morgan is conflicted and attempts to convince him to spare Gavin. A distressed Morgan balks, trying to decide what to do, when suddenly Gavin is stabbed through the neck from behind by Henry, who had followed Carol. In the present, after Negan's attack, Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) regroup with all the other Alexandria survivors in the storm sewers and come to learn of Carl's impending death. They decide to wait until Negan's assault is over and then head off to Hilltop to regroup. Rick knows Carl will not survive the journey, and he and Michonne remain with Carl. Before leading the rest away, Daryl (Norman Reedus) commends Carl on their survival due to Carl's intent to stay out of the war with the Saviors and the preparations he had made. Carl and Rick spend much time discussing the past; Carl explains why he brought Siddiq here, and how he felt remorse for having killed a youth back during their time at the prison; Rick forgives him for these past transgressions. As Rick and Michonne move Carl up to the church, Carl insists that Rick can become a better person; in his mind (shown in a dream sequence first seen in \\"Mercy\\"), Carl imagined his father in the future had become compassionate rather than vengeful, and devoted his time to raising their family and leading the Alexandria community. All survivors, including Negan, work together harmoniously to make Alexandria a thriving community in this dream. The next morning, Carl sends Rick and Michonne out of the church and shoots himself. Rick and Michonne prepare a burial site to lay Carl to rest. ==Development== Chandler Riggs makes his final regular appearance as Carl Grimes in this episode. The ending of the episode intersects between Carl saying his goodbyes to Rick and Michonne, and Morgan's struggle to kill Gavin with Carol and Ezekiel attempting to talk him down. Director Greg Nicotero saw these scenes in direct contrast with each other, and spent more time planning out how these two scenes would be merged. Nicotero saw Carl's and Morgan's struggles mirroring each other, and had shot Carl's scenes with him on one side of the frame, and Morgan's on the other, to represent this mirroring. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== The episode received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 81% with an average rating of 7.54 out of 10, based on 26 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Focusing on the farewell of one of the series' original characters, \\"Honor\\" delivers an emotional mid-season premiere.\\" ===Ratings=== The mid-season premiere drew a total viewership of 8.28 million with a 3.6 rating in adults aged 18‚Äì49. This was an increase in viewership from the mid-season finale, which had 7.89 million viewers. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Honor\\" at AMC * * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 8) episodes ","title":"Honor (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"56690128","text":"Masayasu may refer to: *Hotta Masayasu *Inaba Masayasu *Masayasu Wakabayashi ","title":"Masayasu"},{"id":"56690169","text":"K.

It marks the debut of his son Utkarsh Sharma as a male lead, who also featured as a child actor in Sharma's 2001 film Gadar: Ek Prem Kathaand Ishita Chauhan. Veteran actress Ayesha Jhulka, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Mithun Chakraborty are in supporting roles in the film. ==Plot== The film starts with Vasudev Shastri, a genius RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agent, being labelled as incompetent because he had failed in an important mission and got himself too injured to work again. Later, when he sits by a park depressed, Nandini, the love of his life, consoles him. The film then goes into a flashback where Vasudev Shastri (Utkarsh Sharma) who is a topper yet charming man who comes to IIT where the second ranker, Nandini Chauhan (Ishitha Chauhan), out of jealousy, decides to make his life hell. She constantly detests him but Vasu (Vasudev Shastri) outsmarts her every time. Besides being the friendly \\"genius\\" around campus, he secretly does a part-time job with RAW where his hacking talents are occupied. The day before the final exam in IIT, Nandini reluctantly visits Vasu to get help regarding a theorem. There, Vasu admits to Nandini that he had been long in love with her. Hearing this, Nandini immediately hatches a cunning plan and gives Vasu sleeping pills so that he is unable to attend the exam next day. However, Vasu outsmarts her this time as well and reaches the exam hall before her. Vasu doesn't at all seem angry with her and instead helps her with an unexpected glitch and walks away smiling after completing his paper. On the day of the results, Nandini comes to know that Vasu had intentionally submitted a blank paper just to let her top. Seeing his dedication towards love, Nandini falls in love with him but doesn't reveal it and flies off to US for her dream job. On the other hand, Senior members of RAW, impressed by Vasu's intelligence, try to convince him to join RAW. After learning that his parents were killed in communal riots planned by ISI of Pakistan, Vasu finally decides to join RAW to take revenge against ISI. The film returns to the present where Vasu, who is labelled incompetent by RAW, uses a walking stick and suffers from acute tinnitus and several injuries since his failed mission. Nandini had taken a break from her job to return to India and take care of Vasu. She takes Vasu to her house in Puducherry, where her mother is pleasantly surprised to see Nandini (who had never valued personal relationships before her career) make huge sacrifices for Vasu's welfare. Vasu and Nandini spend some romantic moments but their happiness is short lived as Vasu starts having hallucinations about his failed mission. A confused Nandini tries to take Vasu to USA for treatment. Vasu refuses and narrates the tragic story of his failed mission to Nandini, after which he leaves to track MRS (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), the mastermind of ISI in India and the prime target of his failed mission. Soon after, it is shown that all the hallucinations were just a drama set up by Vasu to track his enemies. He one by one kills everyone who had helped MRS. On the other hand, MRS senses Vasudev's return and plans to kill him in a masquerade party. In the masquerade party, Vasu saves himself but gets injured once again. Seeing Vasu's miserable condition, Nandini breaks down. MRS, who was secretly observing them, takes advantage of this and kidnaps Nandini. Soon after, the senior members of RAW acknowledge his competence. With the help of RAW, Vasu finds Nandini, saves Mathura from a huge blast and finally kills MRS by drowning him in the river. All members of RAW praise him. The film ends with him sharing a big hug with Nandini. ==Cast== * Utkarsh Sharma as Vasudev Shastri aka Genius * Ishitha Chauhan as Nandini Chauhan * Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Mr Samar Khan / MRS * Mithun Chakraborthy as NSA Chief Jaishankar Prasad * Ayesha Jhulka as Nandini's Mother * KK Raina as Mr Das * Zakir Hussain as Minister * Abhimanyu Singh as Mr. Praveen Joshi * Dev Gill as Mr. Satyajit Rathore * Rajesh Bhati as Samar Khan right hand == Reception == The film received generally poor reviews. Reviews were particularly critical of the confusing narrative and the standard of acting. Bollywood Hungama gave it 1/5 stars saying \\"On the whole, GENIUS is an extremely poor and senseless fare.\\" Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India was equally critical of the film giving it 2/5 stars. The Indian Express gave it a \\"nil\\" rating describing it as feeling redundant. ==Soundtrack== The music of the film is composed by Himesh Reshammiya, and Monty Sharma composed the background score, while lyrics are penned by Manoj Muntashir, Kumaar, and Shabbir Ahmed. The first song of the film \\"Tera Fitoor\\" which is sung by Arijit Singh was released on 12 July 2018 . The album was released on 9 August 2018 by Tips Music. ==ReferencesCategory:2018 films Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:Films scored by Himesh Reshammiya Category:2018 action thriller films Category:Indian action thriller films Category:Indian films Category:Films about the Research and Analysis Wing Category:Films directed by Anil Sharma ","title":"Genius (2018 Hindi film)"},{"id":"56690471","text":"Kesteven is a surname, and may refer to: * Charles Kesteven (died 1923), British government law officer in India * Hereward Kesteven (1881‚Äì1964), Australian medical scientist * John Kesteven (1849‚Äìunknown), English cricketer == See also == * Kesteven Category:Surnames Category:English-language surnames Category:Surnames of English origin Category:Surnames of British Isles origin ","title":"Kesteven (surname)"},{"id":"56690492","text":"The list of shipwrecks in July 1834 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded or otherwise lost during July 1834. ==1 July== ==2 July== ==3 July== ==4 July== ==5 July== ==7 July== ==8 July== ==9 July== ==11 July== ==12 July== ==13 July== ==15 July== ==18 July== ==19 July== ==22 July== ==23 July== ==24 July== ==25 July== ==26 July== ==27 July== ==28 July== ==29 July== ==30 July== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1834-07 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in July 1834"},{"id":"56690510","text":"Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb (born 1979) is an Austrian mathematician who works in image processing and partial differential equations.

It has been chartered and operated since February 2016 by the NGOs SOS M√©diterran√©e and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF or Doctors without borders) as a rescue vessel for migrants and refugees making the Mediterranean crossing in makeshift craft from Libya to Italy as part of the European migrant crisis. The vessel is a converted German coast- guard and fishery protection vessel (then named Meerkatze, built in 1977). The ship has a registered capacity to accommodate 25 crew members and usually carries 4 journalists and can carry up to 300 rescued migrants.Mediterranean: 99 survivors rescued from sinking dinghy but many presumed drowned 28 January 2018 All of the refugees sleep on the deck, as the vessel does not have beds, cabins or accommodation for refugees. In November 2018, The Guardian reported that her flag had been revoked by Panama and Liberia, and there was a search for a prospective flag to register under. ==History== Completed by L√ºrssen in Bremen in 1977, serial ID 13453, the ship was utilised by the German Federal Agency for Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE) unit of the K√ºstenwache, or the German Federal Coast Guard, as a \\"Fischereischutzboot\\" or fishery protection vessel. Meerkatze in German coast guard livery in 2006 The ship was classified by Germanischer Lloyd as a Class E2 Icebreaker, employed principally in the central North Sea and North Atlantic, where thanks to its design it proved excellent at navigating through adverse sea conditions. In 2009 it was decommissioned and replaced by the \\"Meerkatze II\\", previously the research ship Anton Dohrn. It was acquired by Bremen company RS Research Shipping (now Jasmund Shipping), renamed MV Aquarius and re-registered under Gibraltar port of registry. Here it operated until the end of 2015 as a survey vessel for renewable energy, oil & gas industry, and other offshore projects. On 1 September 2018, the vessel's operators changed the ship's name from \\"Aquarius\\" to \\"Aquarius 2\\" and changed its vessel type from \\"research vessel\\" to \\"search and rescue vessel\\". The ship has been operated and managed by Jasmund shipping GmBH since June 2017, and after a brief interval again since 11 September 2018. Prior to this, the ship was managed by Hempel shipping (2009-2017). The ship has been owned by Aquarius GmBH & Co KG since April 2009. On 16 August 2018, the ship was inspected by the Port state control (Pais MoU) at Valletta (Malta) and 5 deficiencies were found related to the crew certificates, oil record book and blocked routes of escape. ===Operations in Mediterranean Sea=== In February 2016 the ship was chartered by humanitarian NGO SOS M√©diterran√©e, to provide open sea rescue and support to migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach the European Union. Operating on missions coordinated by Rome's maritime rescue coordination centre, patrolling the waters around Sicily, Lampedusa, and near the Libyan coast, it provided aid to over 10,000 migrants. On May 25, 2016 the Aquarius returned from its tenth rescue operation, having saved 388 migrants. A Ghanaian boy was born on board who was subsequently named Alex in honor of the Russian captain of the Aquarius, Alexander Moroz.ANTONIO GIANGRANDE -PROFUGOPOLI VITTIME E CARNEFICI: QUELLO CHE NON SI OSA DIRE 2016 L'integrale nella puntata di Report in onda alle 21.10 su Rai 3, scrive Francesca Ronchin il 20 novembre 2017 su \\"Il Corriere della Sera\\".

In June 2018 the ship, carrying 629 migrants from Sudan and Bangladesh saved from the sea, was denied entry to Italy by its new Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and to Malta as well. The Government of Spain offered the ship the chance to dock in the port of Valencia, Spain, and the Italian navy offered full assistance and a marine escort for the trip. Aquarius and its migrants arrived at the Port of Valencia on 17 June. Half of them opted to claim asylum in France, insofar as France opened the doors to anyone from the Aquarius. In August 2018, Spain refused entry to the vessel carrying 141 migrants from Eritrea and Somalia as Spain is not the closest safe port, as stipulated by international law. They were distributed among France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. On 20 September 2018 the Aquarius picked up 10 Pakistanis and a Person from Ivory Coast from a dinghy 28 nautical miles from the Libyan coast and 120 miles from the closest European shore, the Italian island Lampedusa. The same day the Aquarius asked Italy and Malta permission to disembark the eleven migrants and both countries refused. The migrants were handed over to a coastguard vessel off Malta on 29 September 2018, after European governments had agreed to take the people in. The Aquarius 2 returned to Marseille. In the autumn of 2018, the ship was repeatedly denied entry by Italy was instead forced to land in Malta and Spain. Italy had seen more than 700 000 migrants arrive on its shores in the 2013-2018 period. In December 2018, MSF and SOS M√©diterran√©e announced that they had ceased their operations with the ship due repeated accusations of trafficking in waste and criminal activity, but affirmed their determination to \\"resume our activities\\". == Flag == The vessel was flagged under the flag of convenience Gibraltar since February 2018. She was registered as a research and survey vessel, which subsequently led to administrative issues. On 6 August 2018 the Gibraltar Maritime Administration issued a \\"notice of removal\\" for the Aquarius, because she was registered as a survey vessel, but used as a rescue ship. As a result, the ship was warned that she would be removed from Gibraltar registry.\\"Migrant rescue ship Aquarius to be stripped of Gibraltar registration\\" radioexe.co.uk 13 August 2018. Thence, the ship's operators approached other flags in order to register the ship under them. On 10 August 2018, they applied to register the ship with a Vatican-State flag, but this was denied by Vatican. On 27 August 2018 the ship arrived in Marseille and its operator MSF announced that the owner had applied for a registration of the vessel in the flag of convenience Panama on 20 August. However, on 22 September 2018 the maritime authority of Panama announced that it had initiated procedures to remove the Aquarius from its registry, quoting violations of international law with respect to migrants, rescue at sea and refusing to carry the migrants back to the area where they originated (UNCLOS, SOLAS and SAR convention). The Government of Panama initiated the process based on information received from Italy that the Aquarius had not followed international regulations and legal proceedings concerning the transport of migrants. Aquarius was specifically accused of not returning the rescued migrants to Libya as required by the SAR convention. In September 2018, the vessel continued to be classed with Germanischer Lloyd and registered with Gibraltar flag as a research / survey vessel. This led to issues with authorities, as a research and survey vessel cannot operate as a passenger vessel unless it reflects these changes in its registry documents. After the ship returned to Marseille in early October 2018 the owner issued a statement about negotiating to obtain a new flag from Switzerland, Luxembourg or Venezuela. As per Equasis and IHS maritime, on 1 September 2018, the ship changed its name to Aquarius 2 and changed its flag to Germany. As per Equasis and IHS maritime, on 1 November 2018, the ship changed its name to Aquarius Dignitus and changed its flag to Liberia. ==References== ==External links== * Aquarius Current position * On board diary of MV Aquarius * SOS Mediterranee - Voices from the sea Category:Ships Category:Mediterranean Category:Social welfare charities Category:Sea rescue organizations Category:Migrant boat disasters in Europe Category:Fishery protection vessels Category:1977 ships ","title":"Aquarius Dignitus"},{"id":"56690627","text":"Derrick Rossi, 2008 Derrick J.

The editors were Boris Krichevsky, Pavel Teplov, Vladimir Ivanshin and, from 1900, Aleksandr S. Martynov. A total of 12 issues were published in nine volumes. The editorial board of Rabocheye Delo was the foreign center of the Economists. The political trend of Rabocheye Delo was indicated in its first issue: the struggle for the economic interests of the proletariat was proclaimed the basis of all social-democratic activity, while the political tasks were presented as a matter of a distant future. Lenin in his book What Is To Be Done? characterised the position of Rabocheye Delo in the following way: At the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), Rabocheye Delo represented the extreme right wing of the party. == Precedents == Rabocheye Delo was originally founded by the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, in late 1895.

The immediate cause was severe droughts in December 1948 to January 1949 and in March 1949 that destroyed much of the maize crop on which the people of the affected areas relied during its main growing season. This followed two years of erratic rainfall and poor harvests which had depleted the reserves in farmers‚Äô granaries. The effect of crop failure was intensified by the failure of the colonial government to maintain a suitably large emergency grain reserve, delays in importing sufficient relief supplies and its requirement that most of the relief provided was paid for by its recipients. The official death toll from starvation was some 200 people, which may be an underestimate, and it excludes those dying of diseases exacerbated by malnutrition.Vaughan (1987). There is significant disagreement on the underlying causes of the famine. At first, it was blamed on over-intensive cultivation causing soil erosion and on growing tobacco rather than food crops.Kettlewell (1965). Later, colonial underdevelopment through land expropriation, levying rents and taxes on African farmers and underpaying them for their labour and produce was suggested.Vail (1975). More recently, attention has been focussed to the uneven economic and social development of the protectorate in the 1930s and 1940s. This created, firstly, an increased number of employees and tradesmen, who needed to buy their food but who were dependent on the uncertain surpluses arising the system of subsistence agricultural because few farmers produced food primarily for the market rather than their own consumption, and governmental marketing organisations that, far from providing incentives for the production of maize, underpaid those farmers that did grow it commercially. In addition, a range of social changes created an underclass of those without adequate access to farmland or secure employment, vulnerable in times of food shortage: this included many women.Vaughan (1987). ==Agriculture and Climate== ===Rain-fed agriculture=== Throughout the colonial period, the main subsistence crop of the upland areas that formed much of Nyasaland was maize, which had been introduced from Mozambique, probably starting from the 18th century, and which largely supplanted the previous staple cereals sorghum and millet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.McCracken (2012), p. 13. By the end of the colonial era, maize accounted for 60% of the areas planted with food crops, providing Nyasaland's inhabitants with over half their calories.McCann (2005), p. 8. Very few cattle were kept in the Shire Highlands, although many smallholders kept a few sheep or goats and most had at least some chickens.McCracken (2012), p. 14. The traditional maize grown in 1949 was late-maturing variety, requiring at least five to eight centimetres of rainfall in each of the first three months of growth, and a further month to ripen.McCann (2005), p. 8. The Shire Highlands generally meets these conditions throughout the normal five-month growing season but, as maize cultivation was mostly rain-fed, variations in the annual rainfall led to substantial fluctuation in crop productionMiller (1964), pp. 124, 134-5. Most of Nyasaland's rain was generated when the Intertropical Convergence Zone passed over the country, usually between November one year and March the next year, but the amount of rainfall varied under the influence of the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation and other climate anomalies.McCann (2005), pp. 15-16. Regional climatic studies have identified an intense episode of drought throughout Southern Africa between 1946 and 1949. This caused widespread famine in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in 1947 and less severe droughts in Nyasaland in 1947 and 1948 that led to poor harvests in those years. The severe famine in southern Malawi in 1949 was probably the last phase of this episode of drought.Hulme (1996), p.9Rasmusson (1987), p. 10. ===Access to land=== In the 1940s, Nyasaland smallholders relied on hand hoeing, and a farming family which included two able-bodied adults whose main crop was maize could cultivate 4.5 to 5 acres of land (2.0 hectares) a year; single women were barely able to farm one hectare without assistance. Around 1949, average maize yields were 0.4 ton to an acre (equivalent to 0.9 tonne a hectare).Nyasaland Protectorate (1955) p. 6. Pressure on access to land increased from the 1940s: even those with access to sufficient arable land might suffer seasonal hunger before harvests, and occasionally endure more serious food shortages in years of inadequate rainfall. Other family units with less land or labour available were frequently at risk of hunger.Mwakasungura (1986), p. 43. About 70% of African smallholders in the Shire Highlands occupied Native Trust Land, for which they paid no rent. This amounted to around 50% of the land in that area and, as the local population increased, Native Trust Land became congested, and much of it was used for almost continuous maize monocropping without crop rotation or fallow.Bishop (1995), pp. 59-61. Only those with larger holdings could grow significant amounts of cash crops, and tobacco, the one cash crop widely grown with government encouragement in the Central Province, was less suited to the wetter Shire Highlands, so its cultivation was not encouraged there.McCracken (2012), p. 14.Woods (1993), pp. 141-3. The other 30% of African farmers were tenants on European-owned estates. These estates occupied almost 700,000 acres (280,000 hectares) in the Shire Highlands or about 50% of the available land, including much of the most fertile land in this area.Pike (1969), pp. 196-9.Vaughan (1987), p. 71. Estate tenants owed rent, originally satisfied by a form of labour service called thangata, but by 1949 it was normally paid either in cash or by delivering specified quantities of tobacco or other cash crops to the landowner.Kanda≈µire (1977), p. 188. Although there was a significant amount of available land on these estates and rural landlessness was rare, the obligation to produce cash crops to pay rent reduced the areas of land and amount of labour that could be devoted to growing the tenants' own food crops.Iliffe, (1985) p. 276. ===Agricultural marketing=== Before the Second World War, little was done in Nyasaland to encourage the commercial production and distribution of food. Although town dwellers needed to purchase their food, little was grown for sale rather than subsistence, as towns were few and small and transport was expensive. It was left to African smallholders and tenants sell their surpluses on local markets and for small-scale African entrepreneurs to distribute food over limited areas. In normal years, most farmers had only small surpluses to sell in local markets. In addition, government policies that paid artificially low prices for the maize which it bought acted as a disincentive to its production for sale.McCracken (1985), pp. 43-4. The Nyasaland government made a number of wartime emergency regulations to control agricultural production, and it made some of these permanent in the post-war period. In 1947, it set up a Maize Control Board, aiming to ensure supplies of maize were maintained for over 67,000 workers and town dwellers in the Southern Province and the others elsewhere who were unable to grow their own food. However, it was underfunded, it paid very low prices for the maize it bought and it was reluctant to promote higher maize production for the home market or for export on the grounds of the cost of purchasing and storing it.Vaughan (1987), pp. 92-3, 95. The Maize Control Board aimed to handle only around 5% of the national crop and to set up a small grain reserve. However, as its first two years of operation coincided with the poor harvests of1947 and 1948, it only managed to buy around 2% of the crop in those two years, and was unable to establish any reserve.Jayne, Jones and others (1987), p. 217.Vaughan (1987), pp. 96-7. After the famine, the Board more than doubled the price it paid for maize and handled from 7% of the maize crop in 1951, rising to over 10% of an increased crop in 1952.Jayne, Jones and others (1987), p. 217.Thompson and Woodfall (1956), p. 138. ==Narrative of the Famine== ===Background=== Although seasonal hunger before crops were ready to harvest was common in Nyasaland, famine was relatively infrequent in the Shire Highlands during the century after 1850, and the area was sometimes a refuge for those fleeing famine from nearby areas of Mozambique.Morris (2016), pp. 92, 95, 130-1. One drought recorded by early missionaries was in the years 1861 to 1863, which coincided with a time of acute political upheaval that dislocated agriculture, and another occurred in 1922.Morris (2016), p. 217. The 1949 famine occurred in an area of Nyasaland undergoing rapid economic change in the period after the Second World War. Blantyre District was not simply an area of subsistence farming but one of growing employment in the adjacent towns of Blantyre and Limbe, on European- owned tobacco or tea estates or as migrant labour in the Rhodesias and South Africa. Many local African smallholders grew cash crops, mainly tobacco, and farm land was becoming congested and under pressure to produce enough food crops for a growing urban and rural population. The population of Blantyre District was becoming differentiated and much of it, urban and rural, relied on cash earnings to purchase some or all of their food needs.Vaughan (1992), pp. 81-3. The 1949 famine was most severe in the Lunzu and Lirangwe areas of Blantyre District, north of Blantyre city, and was an experience beyond the memory of all except the oldest inhabitants who remembered the 1922 famine. Serious food shortages also occurred in Dedza and Port Herald (Nsanje) districts in that year.Vaughan (1992), p. 72. ===Failing rains=== The rainfall in 1947 and 1948 had been erratic,Rasmusson (1987), p. 10. and in 1947 swarms of locusts had destroyed crops. These events forced farmers to use their stored maize, emptying the reserves in their granaries in advance of the 1949 harvest.Morris (2016), p. 276. The rainy season of 1948-9 began well in Blantyre District, but the rains lessened in November and December 1948, and six rainless weeks followed in late December and January 1949, normally the wettest part of the season, when no rain clouds were seen. There were considerable local variations, but the worst affected areas had only half their average annual rainfall and lost up to a third of their expected crop.Morris (2016), p. 276.Vaughan (1987), pp. 27-9. Some of the earliest- planted maize survived but much of the main crop died, and some farmers were unable to replant their maize for lack of rain and because few had any saved seed to plant after the poor harvests of the previous two years. Those with land near riverbanks that retained moisture could harvest some crops, others had relatives in less severely affected areas or received food rations from their employers, but the majority were dependent on what their own land could grow.Vaughan (1992), pp. 73-4. ===Initial reaction=== The initial government response was hampered by a lack of maize available to distribute. In January, the District Commissioner in Blantyre District became concerned about a growing black market in maize flour in the Blantyre town market, and arranged for some of the maize held in a government store to be sold in that market, although the one ton a day released for sale was only sufficient to feed around 500 families.Baker (1994), p. 185. In February 1949, the governor of Nyasaland did not consider that large amounts of famine relief would be needed. He asked the Southern Rhodesian government to send 1,000 tons of maize as soon as possible, and appointed a local businessman as African Foodstuffs Commissioner to arrange supplies of maize and other staple foods, hoping that the business community would assist in its distribution.Baker (1994), p. 191. After some light rains in February, there was a further four-week drought in March 1949. By then, the situation had become really serious, as most of the maize remaining in farmers‚Äô granaries had been exhausted, much of their cash savings had been spent on buying food and most of their livestock had been sold. Many walked long distances to areas that still had maize for sale or foraged for wild foods. The latter included wild varieties of yam and other tubers, edible roots, small mammals and insects.Morris (2016), p. 277-8.Vaughan (1992), p. 75. In many cases, help from better-off relatives dried up as the drought continued, and many men deserted the wives and families that they could not feed.Vaughan (1992), pp. 76-7. Small amounts of sweet potatoes and cassava planted by some farmers were available from May to September, but only in September 1949 did the government open food distribution centres. These sold maize at three pence a pound and allowed families to purchase 20 pounds for five shillings each week. Those people without cash, even women deserted by their husbands, had to work for food, as only small numbers of the very elderly and destitute were given minimal free rations.Vaughan (1992), pp. 78-9. Initially, these centres issued whole maize kernels which had to be pounded but, by January 1950, some of the centres issued ready milled maize, as many women were too weak to pound it, and could not afford to have it milled.Vaughan (1992), p. 80. ===The climax=== Despite the government food distribution, in December 1949 and January 1950, many people in the worst affected areas, particularly young children and the old, showed signs of severe malnutrition, and deaths occurred among the most vulnerable. Some feeding camps were set up where the elderly and destitute were fed maize porridge twice a day, and the worst cases were taken to Blantyre hospital. Around 200 people were reported to have died of starvation: the shock caused by these famine-related deaths was disproportionate to this official mortality figure, because serious famine had reappeared in this area without warning after an absence of more than a quarter of a centuryIliffe, (1985) p. 264. The official mortality figure may also be an underestimate and it excludes many weakened by hunger, particularly young children and the elderly, that died of diseases they might otherwise have recovered from.Morris (2016), p. 277. The government issued free maize seed and cassava cuttings to those sufficiently able-bodied to plant them, and the 1950 harvest was reasonably plentiful despite the weakness of many farmers. In the planting season of 1950/51 many planted drought-resistant cassava as well as maize.Vaughan (1992), pp. 79-81. The people in the worst-affected areas took some years to recover physically from the famine and to repay their debts and build up food reserves and savings. The social effects, in cases where men had deserted their families or relatives had refused to help distressed families, lasted for many years.Vaughan (1992), p. 81. ===Social differences=== African businessmen or skilled workers and the better-paid government employees that had sufficient cash or assets were little affected by the famine, as were soldiers, policemen and some employees of European or Asian enterprises that were given food rations as part of their pay. Self-employed artisans and traders and those in low-paid, often casual, employment suffered a drastic fall in income as their customers prioritised buying food, or their employment ceased: the degree to which they suffered depended on what savings or saleable assets they had.Vaughan (1992), pp. 83-4. How smallholding farmers managed depended on what cash and food reserves, livestock or other assets they had. In normal times, female-headed households, including those of widows and deserted wives, were usually the poorest group in the community, with little access to land. They often survived by casual work such as beer-brewing or food-for-work labour, both of which ended during the famine. Unless their relatives helped them, these women and their families were very vulnerable. On the other hand, many households of migrant workers received cash from absent husbands throughout the famine.Vaughan (1992), pp. 84-5. ==Relief measures== ===A slow start=== In the early months of 1949, when it was clear that most of the maize crop planted in late 1948 would be lost because of drought, the Nyasaland government asked the Rhodesian Maize Control Board, which had been set-up in the 1930s and maintained buffer stocks and imported of maize to send maize to Nyasaland by rail, even though there were already shortages in Northern Rhodesia and one was predicted for Mashonaland. Around 12,500 tons of maize was supplied by these means, 7,500 by June 1949.Iliffe, (1990) pp. 97, 100,103.Thompson and Woodfall (1956), p. 139. As widespread crop failure in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in 1947 had depleted regional stocks, further emergency supplies had to be brought in from further afield. A total of 12,500 tons of maize was imported by sea during the remainder of 1949 and 1950, mostly from the United States and East Africa.Baker (1994), pp. 181, 194. One problem was finding enough ships in the post-war period to transport the purchased maize by sea to the congested port of Beira. A second was that rail link from Beira to Malawi was interrupted by the collapse of the bridge at Chiromo in late 1948, which limited the amount of maize that could be imported and then distributed through a poorly developed road network.Baker (1994), pp. 65, 194. Once the supplies of maize reached the affected areas the government opened food distribution centres in September 1949 to sell maize at controlled prices.Baker (1994), pp. 192-4. ===Government actions=== The governor Sir Geoffrey Francis Taylor Colby stated that maize rations should be used, firstly, to support essential services such as police and the army, secondly to provide relief in the most affected areas and, thirdly, to contribute towards a reserve, which reached 6,000 tons after the 1950 harvest. He was particularly concerned that making maize available at food distribution centres might discourage people from making their own provisions against future famines.Baker (1994), pp. 194, 196, 204-5. The effects of the drought of 1948-49 were exacerbated by the colonial government's failure to hold food reserves or provide relief supplies rapidly. Although the last major famine in the Shire Highlands was in 1922, there had been local food shortages here, particularly in Blantyre District in 1939, 1941 and 1947.Vaughan (1987), pp. 64-6. Resistance to holding food stocks arose partly from the weak finances of the Nyasaland government, but also from an attitude that government food stores would discourage farmers from keeping their own food reserves and make them dependent on the government in the future.Nyasaland Government (1946), Annexe p. 90. ===After 1949=== Government opposition to holding food reserves changed in the aftermath of the 1949 famine, and governor Colby took a number of steps to prevent a recurrence. Some of these steps were clearly beneficial: in addition to setting up a reserve maize store, he instructed the Maize Control the Board to increase the price paid for maize significantly, which encouraged farmers to grow maize for sale.Jayne, Jones and others (1987), p. 217. In addition, he asked the owners of private estates to grow maize for their own workers on their own land, rather than purchasing it from smallholders.White (1987), p. 209. To reduce the overcrowding that existed in some Native Trust land, the government accelerated a scheme to purchase surplus land on the estates, although the largest purchases were from 1952 onwards.Baker (1994), pp. 234-41. The first of two more doubtful steps was the reduction in the price that the Native Tobacco Board paid for tobacco grown on Native Trust lands. The governor's intention was to reduce the volume of tobacco grown while increasing its quality and using the increased profit the Board made for agricultural development.Baker (1994), p. 113.McCracken (2012), pp. 248-9. This significantly reduced the incomes of most of the farmers that had grown tobacco and did little in the short term to increase the quality of the crop. The introduction in the early 1950s of a compulsory registration scheme for tobacco growers led to a 20% reduction in their numbers by 1955.McCracken (2012), p. 250. Secondly, the agricultural development that the governor proposed involved the appointment of government agricultural officers to enforce soil conservation and land use legislation that was bitterly resented by many African smallholders as it involved them in unpaid labour and took some cultivable land out of use.McCracken (2012), pp. 250, 318-9. Although the main architect of these schemes claimed they were vital to prevent an environmental catastrophe,Kettlewell 1965, pp. 239-41, 243-5, 247. this view was later contradicted and, until the 1980s, soil fertility in most of the country remained adequate.Bishop (1995), pp 61-2, 67-8.Snapp (1998), pp. 2572-88. ==Causes of the famine== ===Views in 1949=== Although the immediate cause of an almost complete failure of the maize harvest in large parts of the Shire Highlands was a lack of rain at critical points in the growing season, the extent and intensity of the ensuing famine in the area has been attributed to a number of additional causes. Later research has cast doubt on the reality of those causes that were widely canvassed at the time, and suggested other possible reasons. Even before 1949, Nyasaland's colonial Agriculture Department held negative views about African agricultural practices, and predicted that, unless they were checked, they would cause a rapid decline in soil fertilityVaughan (1987), pp. 60-1, 64-9. This opinion has been contradicted by more recent research, which showed that in 1998, almost 50 years after the 1949 famine, most soils in Malawi were adequate for growing maize, as fertility had declined much less rapidly than the department had forecast. Most soils tested in 1998 still contained sufficient organic material and nutrients for crop growing, if barely so, although they would have benefited from chemical fertilisers or manure.Snapp (1998), pp. 2572-88. Another view that attempted to place a degree of blame on African smallholders on Native Trust Land was that they were growing tobacco to the detriment of food production.Vaughan (1987), p. 78. Relatively little tobacco was grown on Native Trust Land in the Shire Highlands, partly as the Native Tobacco Board discouraged it where it competed with tobacco grown on European-owned private estates and partly as grades of leaf suitable for cigarettes were difficult to grow in the climate of the Shire Highlands.Pike (1968), p. 197. Farm surveys indicate that only farmers with larger holdings in that area grew tobacco, and these also retained most of their land for food crops.Farringdon (1975). pp. 69-71, 82 Tenants on the private did estates often grow tobacco and other saleable crops to pay rents in lieu of cash, although some preferred to grow maize to sell in local markets and pay a cash rent.White (1987), p. 195. Some large private estates were destroying soil fertility by seeking quick profits: a government survey showed that many were badly managed and deforested, and that their soil and grassland had been abused.White (1987), pp. 203-4. However, most tenants had sufficiently large plots to feed their families and grow the required cash crops; only those tenants with insufficient land or labour to cultivate it suffered in the famine.White (1987), pp. 206-8. ===Underdevelopment theories=== Nyasaland has been described as an Imperial Slum,Vail (1975), p. 89. or as a failed Colonial StateMandala (2006), pp. 505. by two leading proponents of the underdevelopment view of colonialism. The imposition of rents on tenants on private estates and underpayment for the produce of smallholders, together with taxes on both groups, certainly constituted a significant burden on African farmers. However, in the economic boom of the 1940s, these impositions were less significant than in earlier periods.Baker (1975), pp. 56-8. Both Vail and Mandala suggest that the Imperial government showed little interest in Nyasaland, a country without valuable resources but with heavy administration costs. These authors concentrate on the period before 1939, when government revenue was low, with much of it coming from taxes on Africans, and mostly absorbed in routine administration costs, leaving very little available for development. Both also concentrate on the inefficiency and perceived high cost of the protectorate's transport system.Vail (1975), pp. 103-4, 112.Mandala (2006), pp. 519-20. However, Vail's argument that the cost of railway links impoverished the country, preventing the government from promoting efficient peasant agricultureVail (1975), pp. 104, 108-9. is overstated for the latter part of the half-century he covers. The Nyasaland government only had to pay interest and repay capital on the loans for constructing the Trans-Zambezia Railway or Zambezi Bridge if its revenues exceeded target figures. During the period 1930 to 1947, it only paid interest in 1936 and repaid no capital at all. All the accrued liabilities passed to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953.Irvine (1959), pp. 181-2.Nyasaland Protectorate (1946), pp. 39, 66-7. ===Coping strategies=== The seasonal hunger common in pre-colonial times gave rise to several coping strategies. In a subsistence economy, farmers grew food for their families‚Äô needs and small surpluses were usually stored, bartered for livestock or given to dependantsSen (1981), p. 165. Markets where food was exchanged for cash were established during the colonial era, and it is likely that introduction of a market economy eventually created an underclass of the chronically malnourished poor.Vaughan (1991), p. 355. The older strategies were supplemented by the use of cash to make good food deficits, whether it was earned directly, remitted by a migrant worker relative or borrowed.Green (2011), p. 269-70.Vaughan (1992), p. 34. Some coping strategies were still in use in 1949, including growing drought resistant crops like millet, cassava or sweet potatoes in case the maize crop failed, gathering wild food or relying on support from family or friends. However, the growing of sorghum and millet was actively discouraged by government agricultural policies, which also discouraged the cultivation of riverbanks and marshland, both of which retained moisture after the rainy season. Although these policies originated before the 1949 famine, they were not relaxed during or immediately after it.Vaughan (1992), p. 86. The coping strategies described were meant to deal with seasonal hunger, but they helped at least some of those affected by the 1949 famine, mainly during ots early stages. However, the vulnerable groups, including old or disabled people, single women and others without family support were less able to use these strategies. ===Vulnerable groups=== The colonial economy created winners and losers: in 1949, most of Nyasaland's people either experienced hunger that was not life-threatening or, in the case of the most privileged, little or no hunger at all. It was the new vulnerable groups that arose during the colonial period who suffered most in that famine. These included men made landless by eviction from private estates, widows and deserted wives with children, who were unable to cultivate enough land for their subsistence, and casual employees and those self-employed people reliant on a previously buoyant economy.Vaughan (1987), pp. 65-6, 110-12, 127-9.Vaughan (1991), pp. 355-6. In the terms proposed by Amartya Sen, the vulnerable groups mentioned above either lacked a food entitlement or had had their food entitlement sharply reduced by a change in their circumstances,Sen (1981), pp. 7, 154-6. and their exposure to famine was an entitlement failure.Sen (1981), pp. 164-6. A minority of people in Nyasaland in 1949, soldiers, police, some workers on private estates and domestic servants received food rations or food at subsidised prices. Urban workers such as clerks earned enough to give them food security and the families of migrant workers often received cash remittances that gave them security.Vaughan (1987), pp. 104-6. However, the majority of people in 1949 depended on agriculture not rations or earnings. In the years before 1949, a rising population led to fear of land shortage, to more intense cultivation and possibly to some over-cropping. Even so, in the 30 years following the famine, smallholders adapted to smaller farm plots with a substantial increase in the production of maize and other food crops, once the incentives they received made this possible.Cromwell and Zambezi (1974), p.16. It was therefore either not having access to sufficient land to grow their own food or lacking a secure cash income that created the casualties of the 1949 famine. It was not that there was insufficient land or that it was badly managed so much as its distribution was uneven.Vaughan (1992), pp. 115-16. ==Food insecurity in Malawi== For around 30 years after the 1949 famine, the country suffered no significant droughts and its farmers were able to adapt to smaller plots and to increase the production of maize and other food crops substantially, by benefiting from improved seeds and fertilizer. Between 1950 and 1979 the annual maize crop exceeded consumption except in 1963, 1970, 1975 and 1976 and shortfalls were made good from reserves. However, after 1980 food insecurity became an increasing problem in the country, leading to a perennial Malawian food crisis.Smale and Heisey (1997), p.65. Bad weather in 1980, 1990, 1997 and 1998 significantly reduced maize harvests, but famines were avoided.Malawi Government (2002), pp 46, 63. In 1997 and 1998, famine was averted by the release of government grain reserves and overseas maize purchases, whereas in 2001 and 2002, when harvests were not as bad as in 1997 or 1998, deficiencies in grain reserves and import delays led to a significant famine.Tiba (2005), pp 69-70. Malawi suffered widespread food shortages in the 1990s and 2000s, and several of the issues which arose then were the same as those already apparent in 1949. These included the use of land for farming tobacco and other non-food crops, the growth of an underclass of land-poor or landless rural people who were dependent on casual work and the strict governmental controls on growing and marketing of certain crops.Conroy (2006), pp. 123, 125. In more recent times, as in 1949, it was the lack of food reserves within the country and delays in importing relief supplies that turned shortages into famine. Even the idea, probably incorrect in 1949, that soil fertility was declining and soil erosion was becoming critical had become true by 1992, when cultivation had spread up hillsides and onto steep Rift Valley slopes, where erosion was inevitable and unsustainable.Young (2000), pp. 243-4. ==References== ==Sources== *C Baker, (1975). ‚ÄúTax Collection in Malawi: An Administrative History‚Äù.

It opened in 1838; operas, plays, pantomimes and other events were held, and leading entertainers performed at the theatre. It was destroyed by fire in 1880. ==Background and opening== The theatre was built by Joseph Wyatt; formerly a haberdasher, he had been a lessee of the first theatre in Sydney, the Theatre Royal, since 1835, and the sole lessee since 1836. In that year he planned another larger theatre. The building was designed by Henry Robertson; the foundation stone was laid on 7 September 1836.Royal Victoria Theatre (Sydney) Australian Variety Theatre Archive. Retrieved 26 February 2018. The new theatre, in Pitt Street, opened on 26 March 1838, with a performance of Shakespeare's Othello. The theatre had a three-storey fa√ßade of Georgian style, and the front section included a hotel. The interior was of Regency style. There were 1,900 seats. 1,000 were in a large pit extending below the dress circle ‚Äì the first theatre in Australia to have this arrangement ‚Äì with upper circle and gallery above. Entry to the dress and upper circle was through the main entrance, and other patrons used a side entrance. The Sydney Monitor reported that the building was \\"truly elegant. ... From the pit you would suppose that you were in a large provincial theatre in England.\\" In 1841 the theatre was fitted with gas lighting.Richard Fotheringham, Angela Turner. Australian Plays for the Colonial Stage. University of Queensland Press. 2006. Page 48. ==Following years== Actors associated with the Theatre Royal moved to the Victoria Theatre, including John Lazar, who was manager of the theatre until the early 1840s. The population of Sydney was small in relation to the size of the theatre, so that a proper repertoire could not be built up: there were frequent changes of programme, leading to poorly rehearsed performances. In March 1841 Wyatt sailed for England to recruit actors, returning in January 1843. While he was away the theatre was managed by William Knight, a hotel owner. The new actors engaged faced opposition from the Sydney actors, and the Sydney Morning Herald commented on 25 January 1843: \\"Of the twelve brought out by him from England there is not one equal in ability to the leading members, male or female, of the old company\\". Wyatt eventually sacked some of his actors. Operas, dramas, burlesques, pantomimes and other amusements were held. George Coppin made his Australian debut in the theatre in 1843. Other performers seen during the theatre's history included Lola Montez, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, Anna Bishop, George Darrell and William Creswick. The first opera written, composed and produced in Australia, Don John of Austria, premiered there in May 1847.Program notes, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, October 2007 In 1854 the theatre was purchased by a consortium including Joshua Josephson, and leased by a succession of managers.

Blowhole on ocean coast of Huriawa Peninsula Huriawa, commonly known as Huriawa Peninsula or Karitane Peninsula, is a headland on the coast of Otago, New Zealand. It is located 35 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre, immediately to the southeast of the settlement of Karitane. The peninsula is steep and rocky, and stretches east for approximately 1000 metres from the mainland at the mouth of the Waikouaiti River. At its narrowest, the isthmus connecting it with Karitane is only some 90 metres in width.

Early on in her career she was associated with the Berlin Secession movement. She is best known for her portraits.Heinrich Eugen von Zitzewitz: Augusta von Zitzewitz. Waisenhaus Buchdruckerei, Braunschweig 1970. == Life == Augusta von Zitzewitz was born in Berlin, a daughter of the Prussian Oberleutnant Coelestin Friedrich von Zitzewitz and his wife, born Elise K√∂bel. Because of her mother's English provenance she and her eight siblings grew up bilingual. According to family tradition she was christened \\"Augusta\\" after the empress Augusta of Saxe- Weimar-Eisenach (1811-1890), the politically liberal wife of the old German emperor. Her father died in 1892, a few months after her eleventh birthday, and she was sent away to complete her education at the \\"Kaiserin-Augusta- Stift\\", a Potsdam boarding school which later formed the unsympathetic backdrop for Christa Winsloe's drama, Girls in Uniform. In 1907, presumably with the backing of her widowed mother, in 1907, she embarked on an arts training with the Berlin Association of Women Artists (\\"Verein der Berliner K√ºnstlerinnen\\"). An arts training at one of the more mainstream Berlin academies would not have been accessible to her on account of her gender. One of her teachers during the next few years was the \\"Secessionist\\", George Mosson. She rented her own little studio in 1911, the year in which she was admitted to membership of the Berlin Association of Women Artists. She had been urged by K√§the Kollwitz to familiarise herself with modern art trends and artists in Paris. In Autumn 1912 she went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian. She also studied with the Cubist, Jean Metzinger. Her studies in Paris, where she was also taught by Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac and Henri Le Fauconnier, continued till 1914. Her friends Helen Grund and Fanny Remark were also studying in Paris at this time. Along with her studies, von Zitzewitz found time in Paris to make contact with the art dealer Israel Ber Neumann and to spend time with the circle of avant-garde cubists around Henri Matisse who would gather at the Caf√© du Dome. Augusta von Zitzewitz married the art- historian Erich R√∂mer (1888-1934) in 1914. Their daughter, Ilse-Marie R√∂mer (1915-1964) was born the next year. Ilse-Marie would later often model for her mother. It was also in 1915 that she became a member of the recently formed Free Secession artists' association. During the next couple of decades she established herself as an artist, producing landscapes, interiors, still lifes and nudes. Notable portrait subjects included members of the Berlin intellectual and cultural milieu such as Alfred Kerr, Max Herrmann-Neisse, Louise Schr√∂der, Claire Waldoff and Ren√©e Sintenis. She also had an important sideline in woodcut prints, notably for the radical leftwing political weekly Die Aktion, between 1917 and 1932. Her mother died in 1922. From this point till she died Augusta von Zitzewitz lived at Reichsstra√üe 97 in Berlin- Westend. At the start of 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. In opposition the Nazis had based their appeal on the traditional populist twin pillars of hatred and hope. The shrill antisemitism on display at Nazi meeting during the 1920s was integrated into government strategy in ways that many found hard to comprehend. Erich R√∂mer was identified by the authorities as Jewish, which meant that the couple's daughter, Ilse, was classified as half-Jewish. Between 1933 and 1945 Augusta von Zitzewitz was subjected to a ban on working or exhibiting inside Germany. The Nazi writ did not run in North America, however, and she was able to exhibit at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. Ilse faced additional race-based risks and was prevented from attending secondary school. Despite the ban, she produced a succession of further portraits on a private basis.

Von Zitzewitz returned to her destroyed studio in Berlin-Charlottenburg (Reichstra√üestra√üe 97) which she had left shortly before the war ended. Charlottenburg had ended up at the heart of what became West Berlin. The priority was on survival. She painted portraits using the light from a kerosene lamp and exchanged them for food. And as the rubble began to be cleared and the rebuilding got under way she re-established her place in the arts scene, once more painting leading figures from the literary and arts scenes. She was now able to stage exhibitions across West Germany, notably in Munich, Hamburg and Bremen. There were exhibitions in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1950 and 1958, followed in 1961 by a posthumous commemorative exhibition in the context of that year's Greater Berlin Arts Exhibition.Hans Vollmer (Ed.): Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler des XX.

Hate speech online is situated at the intersection of multiple tensions: it is the expression of conflicts between different groups within and across societies; it is a vivid example of how technologies with a transformative potential such as the Internet bring with them both opportunities and challenges; and it implies complex balancing between fundamental rights and principles, including freedom of expression and the defense of human dignity. Hate speech is a broad and contested term. Multilateral treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have sought to define its contours. Multi- stakeholders processes (e.g. the Rabat Plan of Action) have been initiated to bring greater clarity and suggest mechanisms to identify hateful messages. And yet, hate speech continues largely to be used in everyday discourse as a generic term, mixing concrete threats to individuals' and groups' security with cases in which people may be simply venting their anger against authority. Internet intermediaries‚Äîorganizations that mediate online communication such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google‚Äîhave advanced their own definitions of hate speech that bind users to a set of rules and allow companies to limit certain forms of expression. National and regional bodies have sought to promote understandings of the term that are more rooted in local traditions. The Internet's speed and reach makes it difficult for governments to enforce national legislation in the virtual world. Issues around hate speech online bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), and the challenges that these spaces pose for regulators. Some of the companies owning these spaces have become more responsive towards tackling the problem of hate speech online. The character of hate speech online and its relation to offline speech and action are widely talked about‚Äîby politicians, activists and academics‚Äîbut the debates tend to be removed from systematic empirical evidence. The character of perceived hate speech and its possible consequences has led to placing much emphasis on the solutions to the problem and on how they should be grounded in international human rights norms. Yet this very focus has also limited deeper attempts to understand the causes underlying the phenomenon and the dynamics through which certain types of content emerge, diffuse and lead‚Äîor not‚Äîto actual discrimination, hostility or violence. == Definitions == === Hate speech === Hate speech lies in a complex nexus with freedom of expression, individual, group and minority rights, as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. Its definition is often contested. In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm (particularly, discrimination, hostility or violence) based upon the target's being identified with a certain social or demographic group. It may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. The concept may extend also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted discrimination, hostility and violent attacks. At critical times, such as during elections, the concept of hate speech may be prone to manipulation: accusations of fomenting hate speech may be traded among political opponents or used by those in power to curb dissent and criticism. Hate speech (be it conveyed through text, images or sound) can be identified by approximation through the degrading or dehumanizing functions that it serves. There may be two types of messages. The first is to the targeted group and functions to dehumanize and diminish members assigned to this group. It often sounds more or less like: \\"Don't be fooled into thinking you are welcome here. [...] You are not wanted, and you and your families will be shunned, excluded, beaten, and driven out, whenever we can get away with it. We may have to keep a low profile right now. But don't get too comfortable. [...] Be afraid.\\" Another function of hate speech is to let others with similar views know they are not alone, to reinforce a sense of an in-group that is (purportedly) under threat. A typical message sent this time to like-minded individuals can read like: \\"We know some of you agree that these people are not wanted here. We know that some of you feel that they are dirty (or dangerous or criminal or terrorist). Know now that you are not alone. [...] There are enough of us around to make sure these people are not welcome. There are enough of us around to draw attention to what these people are really like\\". === Characteristics === The proliferation of hate speech online, observed by the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues (HRC, 2015), poses a new set of challenges. Both social networking platforms and organizations created to combat hate speech have recognized that hateful messages disseminated online are increasingly common and have elicited unprecedented attention to develop adequate responses.See Council of Europe, \\"Mapping study on projects against hate speech online\\", 15 April 2012. See also interviews: Christine Chen, Senior Manager for Public Policy, Google, 2 March 2015; Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, Facebook, 14 January 2015 According to HateBase, a web-based application that collects instances of hate speech online worldwide, the majority of cases of hate speech target individuals based on ethnicity and nationality, but incitements to hatred focusing on religion and class have also been on the rise.See HateBase, Hate speech statistics, http://www.hatebase.org/popular While hate speech online is not intrinsically different from similar expressions found offline, there are peculiar challenges unique to online content and its regulation. Those challenges related to its permanence, itinerancy, anonymity and cross-jurisdictional character are among the most complex to address. Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute, has noted, \\"The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can inflict on the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesn't stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates.\\"Interview: Andre Oboler, CEO, Online Hate Prevention Institute, 31 October 2014. Twitter's conversations organized around trending topics may facilitate the quick and wide spreading of hateful messages, but they also offer the opportunity for influential speakers to shun messages and possibly end popular threads inciting violence. Facebook, on the contrary, may allow multiple threads to continue in parallel and go unnoticed; creating longer lasting spaces where certain individuals and groups are offended, ridiculed and discriminated. Hate speech online can be itinerant. Even when content is removed, it may find expression elsewhere, possibly on the same platform under a different name or on different online spaces. If a website is shut down, it can quickly reopen using a web-hosting service with less stringent regulations or via the reallocation to a country with laws imposing higher threshold for hate speech. The itinerant nature of hate speech also means that poorly formulated thoughts that would have not found public expression and support in the past may now land on spaces where they can be visible to large audiences.There are cases of individuals who had to serve jail sentences for tweets written when drunk or for having jokingly tweeted they were planning to blowing up an airport (Rowbottom 2012). Anonymity can also present a challenge to dealing with hate speech online. \\"(T)he internet facilitates anonymous and pseudonymous discourse, which can just as easily accelerate destructive behavior as it can fuel public discourse\\".Citron & Norton 2011 As Drew Boyd, Director of Operations at The Sentinel Project, has stated, \\"the Internet grants individuals the ability to say horrific things because they think they will not be discovered. This is what makes online hate speech so unique, because people feel much more comfortable speaking hate as opposed to real life when they have to deal with the consequences of what they say\\".Interview: Drew Boyd, Director of Operations, The Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, 24 October 2014. Some governments and social media platforms have sought to enforce real name policies. Such measures have been deeply contested as they hit at the right to privacy and its intersection with free expression. The majority of online trolling and hate speech attacks come from pseudonymous accounts, which are not necessarily anonymous to everyone.Interview: Ian Brown, University of Oxford, 26 November 2014. Genuinely anonymous online communications are rare, as they require the user to employ highly technical measures to ensure that he or she cannot be easily identifiable. A further complication is the transnational reach of the Internet, raising issues of cross jurisdictional co-operation in regard to legal mechanisms for combating hate speech. While there are Mutual Legal Assistance treaties in place among many countries, these are characteristically slow to work. The transnational reach of many private- sector Internet intermediaries may provide a more effective channel for resolving issues in some cases, although these bodies are also often impacted upon by cross-jurisdictional appeals for data (such as revealing the identity of the author of a particular content). State prosecution of online hate speech can be difficult when the countries involved have different commitments and understanding what hate speech is. This is particularly apparent in the context of the US, who both host a large portion of internet servers, as well as having a deep-rooted constitutional commitment to Freedom of Speech. Unlike the dissemination of hate speech through conventional channels, hate speech dissemination online often involves multiple actors, whether knowingly or not. When perpetrators makes use of an online social platform to disseminate their hateful message they do not only hurt their victims, but may also violate terms of service in that platform and at times even state law, depending on their location. The victims, on their part, may feel helpless in the face of online harassment, not knowing to whom they should turn to for help. In the types of responses mapped throughout the study, it appears that collective action, usually undertaken by nongovernmental organizations and lobby groups, has been an effective modus operandi to raise awareness and encourage different stakeholders to take action. === Stormfront precedent === In the aftermath of 2014's dramatic incidents, calls for more restrictive or intrusive measures to contain the Internet's potential to spread hate and violence are common, as if the links between online and offline violence were well known. On the contrary, as the following example indicates, appearances may often be deceiving. Stormfront is considered the first \\"hate website\\".Meddaugh and Kay, 2009 Launched in March 1995 by a former Ku Klux Klan leader, it quickly became a popular space for discussing ideas related to Neo-Nazism, White nationalism and White separatism, first in the United States of America and then globally.Bowman-Grieve, 2009 The forum hosts calls for a racial holy war and incitement to use violence to resist immigration and is considered a space for recruiting activists and possibly coordinating violent acts.Chang et al. 2014 The few studies that have explored who the users of Stormfront actually are depict a more complex picture. Rather than seeing it as a space for coordinating actions, well-known extreme right activists have accused the forum to be just a gathering for \\"keyboard warriors\\". One of them for example, as reported by De Koster and Houtman, stated, \\"I have read quite a few pieces around the forum, and it strikes me that a great fuss is made, whereas little happens. The section activism/politics itself is plainly ridiculous. [...] Not to mention the assemblies where just four people turn up\\".De Koster and Houtman, 2008 Even more revealing are some of the responses to these accusations provided by regular members of the website. As one of them argued, \\"Surely, I am entitled to have an opinion without actively carrying it out. [...] I do not attend demonstrations and I neither join a political party. If this makes me a keyboard warrior, that is all right. I feel good this way. [...] I am not ashamed of it\\". De Koster and Houtman surveyed only one national chapter of Stormfront and a non-representative sample of users, but answers like those above should at least invite to caution towards hypotheses connecting expressions and actions, even in spaces whose main function is to host extremist views. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a study in 2014 that found users of the site \\"were allegedly responsible for the murders of nearly 100 people in the preceding five years.\\" == Frameworks == === International principles === Hate speech is not explicitly mentioned in many international human rights documents and treaties, but it is indirectly called upon by some of the principles related to human dignity and freedom of expression. For example, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was drafted as a response to the atrocities of the World War II, contains the right to equal protection under the law in Article 7, which proclaims that: \\"All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination\\".UDHR, Art 7. The UDHR also states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes \\"freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\\".UDHR, Art 19. The UDHR was decisive in setting a framework and agenda for human rights protection, but the Declaration is non-binding. A series of binding documents have been subsequently created to offer a more robust protection for freedom of expression and protection against discrimination. Out of those documents, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is the most important and comprehensive when addressing hate speech and contains the right to freedom of expression in Article 19 and the prohibition of advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence in Article 20. Other more tailored international legal instruments contain provisions that have repercussions for the definition of hate speech and identification of responses to it, such as: the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1951), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ICERD (1969), and, to a lesser extent, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW (1981). === Hate speech and the ICCPR === The ICCPR is the legal instrument most commonly referred to in debates on hate speech and its regulation, although it does not explicitly use the term \\"hate speech\\". Article 19, which is often referred to as part of the \\"core of the Covenant\\",Nowak 1993 provides for the right to freedom of expression. This sets out the right, and it also includes general strictures to which any limitation of the right must conform in order to be legitimate. Article 19 is followed by Article 20 that expressly limits freedom of expression in cases of \\"advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence\\".Leo et al. 2011 The decision to include this provision, which can be characterised as embodying a particular conceptualisation of hate speech, has been deeply contested. The Human Rights Committee, the United Nations body created by the ICCPR to oversee its implementation, cognizant of the tension, has sought to stress that Article 20 is fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression.Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 11, Article 20: Prohibition of Propaganda for War and Inciting National, Racial or Religious Hatred, 29 July 1983, para. 2. In 2011, The Committee elucidated its views on the relationship of Article 19 and 20 when it reaffirmed that the provisions complement each other and that Article 20 \\"may be considered as lex specialis with regard to Article 19\\". Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 34, Article 19: Freedoms of opinion and expression, CCPR/C/GC/34, 12 September 2011, paras. 48-52. In the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It can legitimately be limited by states under restricted circumstances: \\"3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.\\"Article 19 (3) if the ICCPR. Between Article 19 (3) and Article 20, there is a distinction between optional and obligatory limitations to the right to freedom of expression. Article 19 (3) states that limitations on freedom of expression \\"may therefore be subject to certain restrictions\\", as long as they are provided by law and necessary to certain legitimate purposes. Article 20 states that any advocacy of (certain kinds of) hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence \\"shall be prohibited by law\\". Despite indications on the gravity of speech offenses that should be prohibited by law under Article 20, there remains complexity.Even the Human Rights Committee, which has decided on cases concerning Article 20, has avoided providing a definition of incitement to hatred. Human Rights Council. Incitement to Racial and Religious Hatred and the Promotion of Tolerance: Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, 20 September 2006, para. 36. In particular there is a grey area in conceptualising clear distinctions between (i) expressions of hatred, (ii) expression that advocate hatred, and (iii) hateful speech that specifically constitutes incitement to the practical harms of discrimination, hostility or violence. While states have an obligation to prohibit speech conceived as \\"advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence\\", as consistent with Article 20 (2),Faurisson v. France , C. Individual opinion by Elizabeth Evatt and David Kretzmer, co-signed by Eckart Klein (concurring), para. 4. how to interpret such is not clearly defined.Human Rights Council. Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Addendum, Expert seminar on the links between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, A/HRC/10/31/Add.3, 16 January 2009, para. 1. === Other international legal instruments === ==== ICERD ==== The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which came into force in 1969, has also implications for conceptualising forms of hate speech. The ICERD differs from the ICCPR in three respects. Its conceptualisation of hate speech is specifically limited to speech that refers to race and ethnicity. It asserts in Article 4, paragraph (a), that state parties: \\"Shall declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another color or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; This obligation imposed by the ICERD on state parties is also stricter than the case of Article 20 of the ICCPR covering the criminalisation of racist ideas that are not necessarily inciting discrimination, hostility or violence.\\" An important difference is in the issue of intent. The concept of \\"advocacy of hatred\\" introduced in the ICCPR is more specific than discriminatory speech described in the ICERD, since it is taken to require consideration of the intent of author and not the expression in isolation‚Äîthis is because \\"advocacy\\" is interpreted in the ICCPR as requiring the intent to sow hatred.Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, para. 39; The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has actively addressed hate speech in its General Recommendation 29, in which the Committee recommends state parties to: \\"(r) Take measures against any dissemination of ideas of caste superiority and inferiority or which attempt to justify violence, hatred or discrimination against descent-based communities; (s) Take strict measures against any incitement to discrimination or violence against the communities, including through the Internet; (t) Take measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent- based discrimination;\\"Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, General Recommendation 29, Discrimination Based on Descent (Sixty-first session, 2002), U.N. Doc. A/57/18 at 111 (2002), reprinted in Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N.Doc. HRI\\\\GEN\\\\1\\\\Rev.6 at 223 (2003), paras. r, s and t These points, which reflect the ICERD's reference to the dissemination of expression, have significance for the Internet. The expression of ideas in some online contexts may immediately amount to spreading them. This is especially relevant for private spaces that have begun to play a public role, as in the case of many social networking platforms. ==== Genocide Convention ==== Similarly to the ICERD, the Genocide Convention aims to protect groups defined by race, nationality or ethnicity, although it also extends its provisions to religious groups. When it comes to hate speech the Genocide Convention is limited only to acts that publicly incite to genocide, recognized as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\\", regardless of whether such acts are undertaken in peacetime or in wartime.Defeis 1992 Specifically gender-based hate speech (as distinct from discriminatory actions) is not covered in depth in international law. ==== CEDAW ==== The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1981, imposes obligations on states to condemn discrimination against womenArticle 2 of the CEDAW. and \\"prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish\\" acts of gender-based violence.General recommendation No. 28 on the core obligations of States parties under article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Para. 19 === Regional responses === Most regional instruments do not have specific articles prescribing prohibition of hate speech, but they more generally allow states to limit freedom of expression‚Äîwhich provisions can be applied to specific cases. ==== American Convention on Human Rights ==== The American Convention on Human Rights describes limitations on freedom of expression in a manner similar to the ICCPR in Article 19 (3). The Organization of American States has also adopted another declaration on the principles of freedom of expression, which includes a specific clause stating that \\"prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or impartiality is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments\\".Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Inter- American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression, 20 October 2000, para. 7. The Inter-American Court has advised that \\"(a)buse of freedom of information thus cannot be controlled by preventive measures but only through the subsequent imposition of sanctions on those who are guilty of the abuses\\".Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para. 39 The Court also imposes a test for States willing to enact restrictions on freedom of expression, as they need to observe the following requirements: \\"a) the existence of previously established grounds for liability; b) the express and precise definition of these grounds by law; c) the legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved; d) a showing that these grounds of liability are ‚Äònecessary to ensure' the aforementioned ends.\\"Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39. The Inter-American System has a Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression who conducted a comprehensive study on hate speech. His conclusion was that the Inter-American Human Rights System differs from the United Nations and the European approach on a key point: The Inter-American system covers only hate speech that actually leads to violence, and solely such speech can be restricted. ==== African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights ==== The African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights takes a different approach in Article 9 (2), allowing for restrictions on rights as long as they are \\"within the law\\". This concept has been criticized and there is a vast amount of legal scholarship on the so-called \\"claw-back\\" clauses and their interpretation.Viljoen 2012 The criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that countries can manipulate their own legislation and weaken the essence of the right to freedom of expression. The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa elaborates a higher standard for limitations on freedom of expression. It declares that the right \\"should not be restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression\\".African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, 32nd Session, Banjul, 17‚Äì23 October 2002. ==== Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam ==== In 1990, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (which was later renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OIC) adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (CDHRI), which calls for criminalisation of speech that extends beyond cases of imminent violence to encompass \\"acts or speech that denote manifest intolerance and hate\\".Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Sixth OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia, Presented to the 40th Council of Foreign Ministers, Conakry, Republic of Guinea, December 2013, p 31. ==== Arab Charter on Human Rights ==== The Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was adopted by the Council of the League of Arab States in 2004, includes in Article 32 provisions that are relevant also for online communication as it guarantees the right to \\"freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, regardless of geographical boundaries\\".League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (1) It allows a limitation on a broad basis in paragraph 2 \\"Such rights and freedoms shall be exercised in conformity with the fundamental values of society\\".League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (2). ==== ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ==== The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration includes the right to freedom of expression in Article 23. Article 7 of the Declaration provides for general limitations, affirming, \\"the realisation of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds.\\"Article 7 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. ==== Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ==== The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which declares the right to freedom of expression in Article 11, has a clause which prohibits abuse of rights. It asserts that the Charter must not be interpreted as implying any \\"limitation to a greater extent than is provided for therein\\".Article 54 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. An example of a limitation which implies a strict test of necessity and proportionality is the provision on freedom of expression in the European Convention on Human Rights, which underlines that the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities. It \\"may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary\\".Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights is careful to distinguish between hate speech and the right of individuals to express their views freely, even if others take offence.Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, para. 49. More cases of hate Speech under the European Court can be found at: http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf 49 There are regional instances relevant specifically to online hate speech. The Council of Europe (CoE) in 2000 issued a General Policy Recommendation on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Anti-Semitic Material via the Internet.ECRI General Policy Recommendation No. 6, On Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Antisemitic Material via the Internet, adopted on 15 December 2000. The creation of the CoE Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, which regulates mutual assistance regarding investigative powers, provides signatory countries with a mechanism to deal with computer data, which would include transnational hate speech online.Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, paras 31‚Äì34. In 2003 the CoE launched an additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime which addresses online expression of racism and xenophobia. The convention and its protocol were opened for signature and ratification of countries outside Europe, and other countries, such as Canada and South Africa, are already part of this convention. The Protocol imposes an obligation on Member States to criminalise racist and xenophobic insults online of \\"(i) persons for the reason that they belong to a group distinguished by race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics\\".Council of Europe, Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, 28 January 2003, art 5 para 1. === Private spaces === Internet intermediaries such as social networking platforms, Internet Service Providers or Search Engines, stipulate in their terms of service how they may intervene in allowing, restricting, or channelling the creation and access to specific content. A vast amount of online interactions occur on social networking platforms that transcend national jurisdictions and which platforms have also developed their own definitions of hate speech and measures to respond to it. For a user who violates the terms of service, the content he or she has posted may be removed from the platform, or its access may be restricted to be viewed only by a certain category of users (e.g. users living outside a specific country). The principles that inspire terms of service agreements and the mechanisms that each company develops to ensure their implementation have significant repercussions on the ability that people have to express themselves online as well as to be protected from hate speech. Most intermediaries have to enter in negotiations with national governments to an extent that varies according to the type of intermediary, areas where the company is registered, and the legal regime that applies. As Tsesis explains, \\"(i)f transmissions on the Internet are sent and received in particular locations, then specific fora retain jurisdiction to prosecute illegal activities transacted on the Internet\\".Tsesis, 2001 Internet Service Providers are the most directly affected by national legislation because they have to be located in a specific country to operate. Search Engines, while they can modify search results for self-regulatory or commercial reasons, have increasingly tended to adapt to the intermediary liability regime of both their registered home jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which they provide their services, either removing links to content proactively or upon request by authorities.MacKinnon et al. 2015 All Internet intermediaries operated by private companies are also expected to respect human rights. This is set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights elaborated by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The document emphasizes corporate responsibility in upholding human rights. In principle 11, it declares that: \\"Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved\\".http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 11. The United Nations Guiding Principles also indicate that in cases in which human rights are violated, companies should \\"provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes\\".http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 22. In the case of Internet intermediaries and conceptions of hate speech, this means that they should ensure that measures are in place to provide a commensurate response. == Social responses == === Case studies === ==== Myanmar ==== Myanmar is transitioning towards greater openness and access to the Internet has grown at unprecedented rates. In this context, however, social media have often been used by some to spread calls to violence.Hereward Holland, \\"Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?,\\" Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar- rohingya-amplifying-hatespeech-2014612112834290144.html In 2014, the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her concern over the spread of misinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, discrimination and hostility in the media and Internet, particularly targeted against a minority community.HRC, 2015 The growing tension online has gone parallel with cases of actual violence leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced.\\"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?\\", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788 One challenge in this process has concerned ethnic and religious minorities. In 2013, 43 people were killed due to clashes that erupted after a dispute in the Rakhine state in the Western Part of the country. A year earlier, more than 200 people were killed and thousands displaced 37 because of ethnic violence, which erupted after an alleged rape case.Andrew Marshall, \\"Special Report: Plight of Muslim Minority Threatens Myanmar Spring,\\" Reuters, 15 June 2012, https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-myanmar-rohingya- idUSBRE85E06A20120615 Against this backdrop, the rapid emergence of new online spaces, albeit for a fraction of the population, has reflected some of these deeply rooted tensions in a new form. Dealing with intolerance and hate speech online is an emerging issue. Facebook has rapidly become the platform of choice for those citizens making their first steps online. In this environment there have been individual and groups, which have championed a more aggressive use of the medium, especially when feeling protected by a sense of righteousness and by claims to be acting in defense of the national interest. Political figures have also used online media for particular causes. In social media, there has been the use of derogatory terms in reference to minorities.Erika Kinetz, \\"New Numerology of Hate Grows in Burma\\", Irrawaddy, 29 April 2013 http://www.irrawaddy.org/religion/new-numerology-of-hate-grows- in-burma.html. Hereward Holland, \\"Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?,\\" Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014; Steven Kiersons, \\"The Colonial Origins of Hate Speech in Burma\\", The Sentinel Project, 28 October 2013, https://thesentinelproject.org/2013/10/28/the-colonial-origins-of-hate-speech- in-burma/ ., http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook- myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hate-speech-2014612112834290144.html In this complex situation, a variety of actors has begun to mobilize, seeking to offer responses that can avoid further violence. Facebook has sought to take a more active role in monitoring the uses of the social network platform in Myanmar, developing partnerships with local organizations and making guidelines on reporting problems accessible in Burmese.Tim McLaughlin, \\"Facebook takes steps to combat hate speech\\", The Myanmar Times, 25 July 2014. http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11114-facebook-standards- marked-for-translation.html The local civil society has constituted a strong voice in openly condemning the spread of online hate speech, but at the same time calling for alternatives to censorship. Among the most innovative responses has been Panzagar, which in Burmese means \\"flower speech\\", a campaign launched by blogger and activist Nay Phone Latt to openly oppose hate speech. The goal of the initiative was offering a joyful example of how people can interact, both online and offline.San Yamin Aung, \\"Burmese Online Activist Discusses Campaign Against Hate Speech\\", Irrawaddy, http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html Local activists have been focussed upon local solutions, rather than trying to mobilize global civil society on these issues. This is in contrast to some other online campaigns that have been able to attract the world's attention towards relatively neglected problems. Initiatives such as those promoted by the Save Darfur Coalition for the civil war in Sudan, or the organization Invisible Children with the Kony2012 campaign that denounced the atrocities committed by the Lord Resistance Army, are popular examples. As commentaries on these campaigns have pointed out, such global responses may have negative repercussions on the ability for local solutions to be found.Schomerus, 2012 === Private companies === Internet intermediaries have developed disparate definitions of hate speech and guidelines to regulate it. Some companies do not use the term hate speech, but have a descriptive list of terms related to it. ==== Yahoo! ==== Yahoo!'s terms of service prohibit the posting of \\"content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libellous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable\\". ==== Twitter ==== In December 2017, Twitter began enforcing new policies towards hate speech, banning multiple accounts as well as setting new guidelines for what will be allowed on their platform. There is an entire page in the Twitter Help Center devoted to describing their Hateful Conduct Policy, as well as their enforcement procedures. The top of this page states ‚ÄúFreedom of expression means little if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. We do not tolerate behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person‚Äôs voice. If you see something on Twitter that violates these rules, please report it to us.‚Äù Twitter's definition of hate speech ranges from ‚Äúviolent threats‚Äù and ‚Äúwishes for the physical harm, death, or disease of individuals or groups‚Äù to ‚Äúrepeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone.‚Äù Punishments for violations range from suspending a user's ability to tweet until they take down their offensive/ hateful post to the removal of an account entirely. In a statement following the implementation of their new policies, Twitter said ‚ÄúIn our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process‚Äù . . . ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks, and will keep you posted on progress along the way‚Äù. These changes come amidst a time where action is being taken to prevent hate speech around the globe, including new laws in Europe which pose fines for sites unable to address hate speech reports within 24 hours. ==== YouTube ==== YouTube, a subsidiary of the tech company Google, has outlined a clear ‚ÄúHate Speech Policy‚Äù amidst several other user policies on their website. The policy is worded as such: ‚ÄúWe encourage free speech and try to defend your right to express unpopular points of view, but we don't permit hate speech. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes, such as: race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation/gender identity‚Äù. YouTube has built in a user reporting system in order to counteract the growing trend of hate speech. Among the most popular deterrents against hate speech, users are able to anonymously report another user for content they deem inappropriate. The content is then reviewed against YouTube policy and age restrictions, and either taken down or left alone. ==== Facebook ==== Facebook's terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that \\"Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases\\". It further states that \\"We allow humour, satire or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content.\\" Facebook's hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However, only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments. In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry for the mistakes we have made ‚Äî they do not reflect the community we want to help build‚Ä¶We must do better.\\" There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's hate speech policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes. For example, the statement ‚ÄúFemale sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks,\\" would not be considered hate speech on Facebook's platform and therefore would not be removed. While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation. Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content. When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content's severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys ‚Äúviolent speech or support for death/disease/harm.‚Äù Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies. In March 2019, Facebook banned content supporting white nationalism and white separatism, extending a previous ban of white supremacy content. In May 2019, it announced bans on several prominent people for violations of its prohibition on hate speech, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen. ==== Microsoft ==== Microsoft has specific rules concerning hate speech for a variety of its applications. Its policy for mobile phones prohibits applications that \\"contain any content that advocates discrimination, hatred, or violence based on considerations of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, status as a veteran, or membership in any other social group.\\" The company has also rules regarding online gaming, which prohibit any communication that is indicative of \\"hate speech, controversial religious topics and sensitive current or historical events\\". === Media and information literacy === Media and Information Literacy aims to help people to engage in a digital society by being able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically; while being able to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms. Citizenship education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict.Osler and Starksey, 2005 One of its main objectives is raising awareness on the political, social and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including freedom of speech and the responsibilities and social implications that emerge from it. The concern of citizenship education with hate speech is twofold: it encompasses the knowledge and skills to identify hate speech, and should enable individuals to counteract messages of hatred. One of its current challenges is adapting its goals and strategies to the digital world, providing not only argumentative but also technological knowledge and skills that a citizen may need to counteract online hate speech. Information literacy cannot avoid issues such as rights to free expression and privacy, critical citizenship and fostering empowerment for political participation.Mossberger et al. 2008 Multiple and complementary literacies become critical. The emergence of new technologies and social media has played an important role in this shift. Individuals have evolved from being only consumers of media messages to producers, creators and curator of information, resulting in new models of participation that interact with traditional ones, like voting or joining a political party. Teaching strategies are changing accordingly, from fostering critical reception of media messages to include empowering the creation of media content.Hoechsmann and Poyntz, 2012 The concept of media and information literacy itself continues to evolve, being augmented by the dynamics of the Internet. It is beginning to embrace issues of identity, ethics and rights in cyberspace.See Paris Declaration: Paris Declaration on MIL in the Digital Era. http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication- andinformation/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus- articles/2014/paris-declaration-on-mediaand-information-literacy-adopted/ Some of these skills can be particularly important when identifying and responding to hate speech online. Series of initiatives aimed both at providing information and practical tools for Internet users to be active digital citizens: * ‚ÄòNo place for hate' by Anti-Defamation League (ADL), United States; * ‚ÄòIn other words' project by Provincia di Mantova and the European Commission; * ‚ÄòFacing online hate' by MediaSmarts, Canada; * ‚ÄòNo hate speech movement' by Youth Department of the Council of Europe, Europe;The ‚ÄòNo Hate Speech Movement' is a regional campaign that encompasses 50 countries far beyond the European Continent. Although the campaign has common goals and develops joint strategies, the particular projects and initiatives rune in every country are the responsibility of the National coordinators and subject to the capacity and resources in each country. * ‚ÄòOnline hate' by the Online Hate Prevention Institute, Australia. Education is also seen as being a tool against hate speech. Laura Geraghty from the ‚ÄòNo Hate Speech Movement' affirmed: \\"Education is key to prevent hate speech online. It is necessary to raise awareness and empower people to get online in a responsible way; however, you still need the legal background and instruments to prosecute hate crimes, including hate speech online, otherwise the preventive aspect won't help\\".Interview: Laura Geraghty, No Hate Speech Movement, 25 November 2014. == Sources == == References == Category:Violence against women Category:Violence against Muslims Category:Violence against LGBT people ","title":"Online hate speech"},{"id":"56691034","text":"Yasuo Tanaka may refer to: * Yasuo Tanaka (politician), Japanese novelist and politician * Yasuo Tanaka (astronomer), Japanese astronomer * Yasuo Tanaka (voice actor), Japanese voice actor * Yasuo Tanaka (swimmer), Japanese swimmer ","title":"Yasuo Tanaka"},{"id":"56691063","text":"Flying Monster may refer to: *Flying Monsters 3D, a 2010 documentary by David Attenborough *Flying Spaghetti Monster, the deity of a religion and a social movement *Rodan! the Flying Monster, 1956 Japanese film ","title":"Flying Monster"},{"id":"56691108","text":"Garkon is a village located in Kargil Block of Kargil district, in a rural region in the Indian union territory of Ladakh.

The RMT called on members to strike and notified employers under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 226A it would hold a ballot, gave them a list of 5000 union members under s 234A. The ballot was 4-7 August, 2000 members voted in favour, 622 against. It notified the result under s 234A, with a strike called from 25 August to 4 September. Twenty members had since joined. Mance J held the union had no statutory immunity for any inducements to the 69s members who joined after the ballot, but did not lose immunity for the whole strike. The union appealed. ==Judgment== The Court of Appeal held there was full immunity. Under TULRCA 1992 s 226 a union had statutory immunity from suit for inducing any members to strike where it was supported under TULRCA 1992 ss 226‚Äì232.

He was sent to China for guerrilla training with a view to coming back to fight the colonial government, but upon his return, Zambia was already independent. He demanded to be the Minister Of Tourism and Wildlife in the UNIP government, which Kaunda denied. Out of frustration, he left Zambia together with his followers and went to the then South West Africa (Namibia) under the control of South Africa. He advanced in his guerrilla training and in 1975, after inspiration from Jonas Savimbi of Angola, he came back to Zambia and rebelled against the UNIP government until 1982. It was believed that Mushala was strongly believed to be surviving through a complexity of witchcraft and supernatural powers. There were some unconfirmed reports in Solwezi that the government had even hired some witchdoctors locally and abroad, to come and try to capture him but all was in vain. == Death == A cropped image from a Zambian newspaper showing Mushala's corpse being paraded, after being shot on November 27 1982.

Designed for towing heavy artillery guns, it will replace the aging fleet of Scania SBAT111S used by the Indian Army. ==Development== In 1986, when the Indian Army purchased 410 FH77B Bofors howitzers, they also ordered 660 SBAT111S trucks. 30 years later, these trucks had become obsolete and the Army looked for a replacement. Ashok Leyland is one of the biggest suppliers of logistics vehicles to Indian Army; the company's Stallion truck has over 60,000 units in service with Indian Army. Thus, the development of FAT or Field Artillery Tractor was started as a private venture to replace the ageing fleet of Scania trucks. ==Design & features== The truck is designed on Leyland's \\"Super Stallion\\" platform. It is powered by Ashok Leyland's in-house developed 8-litre Neptune series engine that gives of power and 1,400 Nm of torque at 1,300 rpm. This is mated to an 8-speed manual transmission (2-speed transfer case). The truck runs on full-time 6-wheel drive system with all axles having differential lock. The FAT 6x6's towing capacity is rated at 8 tonnes. The driver's cabin can hold four people and the crew cabin just behind it can hold six. The cargo bay is fitted with a 2.7 tonne crane for loading/unloading ammunition and other equipment. There is a roof hatch for observation, emergency exit and firing. At the front, the truck has a 10 tonne self-recovery winch. Other features include a fire and smoke detection unit, an infrared rear-view camera and central tire inflation system. For driver's comfort, cab is equipped with HVAC. ==Production== In March 2016, Ashok Leyland won a contract for supplying 450 units of the FAT 6x6 along with other \\"Super Stallion\\" vehicles and 825 units of \\"Ambulance 4x4\\" to the army. The total order was worth ‚Çπ800 crore.

The design was authorised in the 1959/1960 Italian naval programme but was radically redesigned in 1962. Circe was laid down as the lead ship in 1963 but was renamed Alpino in June 1965 prior to being launched in 1967. La Spezia As originally designed, Alpino was to have armament based on the preceding . Optimised for anti- submarine warfare, the vessels were designed around a hangar for an Agusta- Bell AB.204 helicopter, complemented by a single-barrel Menon mortar mounted forward. An early drawing shows the hangar straddled by a pair of guns with a single gun mounted fore and aft to provide anti-aircraft defence. By 1962, the efficacy of the 40 mm was in doubt and the design was redrawn with three 76 mm guns, but this was deemed insufficient. At launch, the vessel had no less than six single mounts. The propulsion system uses a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) system first trialled on the destroyer San Giorgio. The system allied two diesels and one gas turbine per shaft with a hydraulic coupling to enable the vessel to either run on diesel power alone, at low speed, or diesels, at high speed, and gas turbines simultaneously. Two Tosi OTV-320 diesels were paired with each Tosi-Metrovick G.6 gas turbine to provide a maximum speed of on diesels alone and with all engines running. ==Service== Commissioned on 14 January 1968, Alpino quickly made a mark as a pioneer of sharply raked bows, the first frigates so equipped in Italian Navy service, as well as gas turbines and variable depth sonar. Between 14 January and 6 June 1973, the ship undertook the longest continuous voyage in the Italian Navy, covering and travelling as far as the Labrador Sea, for which it was awarded a symbolic Blue Nose. Alpino acted as the trial ship for the experimental SPQ-5A Sarchiapone radar between 1973 and 1987. It was reportedly able to locate aircraft during their take-off from the aircraft carrier at a distance of . A SLQ-A ECM system was also added during the 1970s. This was subsequently upgraded to SLQ-D. Consideration was also given to installing the Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile system to improve anti-aircraft capability. The ship was further upgraded during a refit that ended in June 1985. Hull-mounted sonar was fitted and the variable depth sonar rendered inoperable. ==Mine warfare flagship== Between 14 April 1996 and 31 January 1997, Alpino was converted into the flagship for minewarfare, a mine countermeasures support ship, a combat diver support ship and signals intelligence ship with the new penant number A5384. The vessel acted in the flagship role to the Gaeta-class minehunters Crotone and Chioggia from 18 March to 22 June 2002 during a NATO training exercise in Northern Europe. From 13 May 2004, Alpino commanded MCMFORSOUTH while on exercise in the Black Sea.

She began her career as an actress and co-founded a theatre company, La Carotte. She has performed in concert and recorded with the ensemble Le Po√®me Harmonique. On stage, she has performed at opera houses in Paris, Nancy, Lyon and D√ºsseldorf, among others. == Career == Born in Niort (Deux-S√®vres), Druet started as an actress, taking theatre courses in high school in Salins-les-Baths. She then pursued a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes universitaires scientifiques et techniques (DEUST) (Diploma of scientific and technical university studies) degree in Besan√ßon, studying at the University of Franche-Comt√©. Though she sang in the university choir, her musical preferences were for reggae and Indian music. In 2000, she co-founded a theatre company based in Besan√ßon, La Carotte, where theatre, mime, music, dance and storytelling performances were mixed. Torn between theatre and music, she finally moved to Paris and studied music for two years in the 7th arrondissement before entering the National Conservatoire. Studying voice at the Conservatoire de Paris, Druet graduated summa cum laude in 2007. She obtained a master's degree, writing a thesis, La construction du personnage √† l'op√©ra, and attending masterclasses with Ren√© Jacobs and Agn√®s Mellon, among others. In June 2007 she won a first prize in singing with unanimous praise from the jury at the Conservatoire in Isabelle Guillaud's class. That same year, she was elected in the category \\"R√©v√©lation classique lyrique\\" of the Adami. Simultaneously with her final two years at the Conservatoire, Druet performed in the Op√©ra-Comique, Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, as well as at regional festivals. Among her roles were Za√Øde in Europa Galante by Andr√© Campra under the direction of William Christie, which toured in 2005; playing the sorceress in Dido and Aeneas, singing roles in The Clemency of Titus, and playing in the Conservatoire's productions of Eug√®ne Onegin as Mme Larina and in Handel's Alcina as Ruggiero, among many other performances. In 2008, she was awarded second place in the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels, Belgium and sang at Carnegie Hall in New York City with the baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants under the direction of William Christie. The following year, she co-created with Marc Mauillon a presentation for the Emergence Festival. Premiering together, they performed La Valse perdue (The Lost Waltz) by Jacques Offenbach at the Musical Theater of Besan√ßon. The duo continued to perform together, singing at the concert of the Revelations of Victories in 2010, when each of them were awarded the distinction of \\"laureate\\" in the Victoires de la musique classique. After touring throughout Europe, performing both operatic roles and singing baroque lyric concert music, Druet made her US orchestral debut performing with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in 2015. Combining music from two different composers, Argentine Alberto Ginastera and French Maurice Ravel, the concert under the direction of Leonard Slatkin was praised for the thoughtful presentation. Druet was praised for her passionate performance in Ravel's Two Hebraic Melodies, based upon an Aramaic version of the Kaddish. Particularly noted was her performance in Ravel's Sheharazade, for her \\"intelligent phrasing that was seemingly attuned to every nuance embedded in the text\\". === Opera === In 2010, Druet performed the role of Arcabonne in Lully's Amadis. In 2011, she appeared in the title role of Bizet's Carmen at both the op√©ra national de Lorraine in Nancy and at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in D√ºsseldorf. She sang the title role of Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri in Metz. She appeared as Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Druet made her debut at the Paris Opera in 2011 as the Page in Salome by Richard Strauss.

She appeared as Concepci√≥n in Ravel's L'heure espagnole in Lyon, which was recorded, and as Baba Turk in Britten's The Rake's Progress. She has appeared at the Paris Opera as Tisbe in Rossini's La Cenerentola, as Annina in Verdi's La traviata, and as Ciesca in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi. === Concert === Druet began performing with the ensemble Le Po√®me Harmonique, as the group allowed her to explore her interest in a variety of music styles. In 2010, she was featured in a production of Cadmus et Hermione by Lully at the Op√©ra Comique accompanied by Le Po√®me Harmonique and Vincent Dumestre. Druet appeared in concert with Le Po√®me Harmonique, performing and recording rarities such as music by Luis de Brice√±o and his contemporaries.

Near the distal margin of both wings, contiguous to a row of sharply marked small black spots, there are mostly also white elongate spots (absent from the figure of the male), which are not present in the anterior area of the forewing, but may be considerably enlarged at the centre of the distal margin. The white spots situated between the median veins of the forewing stand somewhat nearer the middle of the wing than in duplicata [form of L. helmanni] . The inner edge of the while band on the underside of the hindwing is said to afford an essential difference from duplicata. This edge in doerriesi projects below the subcostal somewhat towards the distal margin , and is here as well as between the radials quite straight or feebly undulate (concave towards the base), while in duplicata the brownish portion of the basal area projects twice in arc-shape into the respectivewhite spots of the band. In the male the rest of the underside is almost as in duplicata, the white band, however, is somewhat narrower and there are distinct black dots in the grey spots of the marginal area. In the rather larger female the outer area of the underside is more evenly ochreous, with white marginal lunules and a row of small elongate white spots in a narrow grey band; before each of these spots there is a black dot, the anal angle as in the male bearing a double dot.

It was of conventional layout but, like many B&V; designs, of innovative structure using a high proportion of steel.Cowin (1963)Luft46 The fuselage nose was fully glazed to provide excellent vision to the crew, all accommodated in the nose cabin. Behind the cabin, the entire centre section of the fuselage formed one giant integral fuel tank. The tail housed a defensive gun turret and a single retractable tailwheel. Further defensive armament was provided by a remote-controlled barbette under the fuselage. The mid-mounted wing was of very high aspect ratio, having a large span combined with a relatively short chord to make it highly efficient. Four identical nacelles, distributed along the constant-chord centre section of the wing, each housed a BMW 801E radial engine providing almost takeoff power, with a retractable main undercarriage leg behind.

The first time I ever heard 'Fake Empire' from Boxer, I will never fucking forget that.\\" ==Critical reception== Bianca Gracie of Fuse complimented Chvrches' ability to \\"effortlessly express tangible emotions in synth-pop\\", writing that the song has \\"a completely different tone\\" than \\"Get Out\\" and \\"leaves you feeling surprisingly empty, but satisfied enough to give it another play\\". Scott Russell of Paste sees the song as \\"another indication that Chvrches are aiming high on their new album, packing more punch than ever in their soaring synth- pop anthems\\". Brian Haack of Grammy Award praised the song, writing: \\"The resulting collaboration touches all the right notes of Chvrches trademark sound: it's lyrically lush and sonically layered enough to wow crowds at festival stages, but also packed with hooks and catchy vocal melodies that should play well on radio and streaming platforms.\\" Lauren O'Neill of Vice wrote: \\"It's airy, light, and more downbeat than its predecessor, and is especially significant as a different sonic landscape from the sort that we're used to from Berninger, who for the record sounds great here.\\" Hayden Manders of Nylon opined that it is \\"decidedly more morose than 'Get Out', but cathartic nonetheless\\". He felt that \\"the song itself is somber, more in the vein of previous songs like 'Tether' and 'Down Side of Me.'\\" Robin Murray of Clash regarded it as \\"a record of both quiet and significant change for the Scottish group\\", calling it \\"a brooding, crystalline piece of synth pop\\" in which \\"every element feels exactly measured\\". Will Richards of DIY deemed it \\"a slower, more contemplative counterpart to the sky-reaching, ballsy 'Get Out'\\", writing that \\"Matt and Lauren's voices prove a near-perfect pair\\". He concluded his review by naming it \\"the first true example of the trio countering their chorus-driven, synth-pop bangers with something slower but just as affecting\\". ==Credits and personnel== Credit adapted from Tidal.

In South Korea, it is a known symbol among K-pop stars and their fans, and is popularly performed using the thumb and index finger. The thumb and index finger gesture has become popular across Asia due to the popularity of K-pop and Korean dramas, and increasingly so in other parts of the world as a factor of the Korean Wave. During the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, The North Face provided gloves with highlighted thumb and index finger sleeves to highlight this symbol. The gesture is very similar to the \\"ask for money\\" gesture, thus causing misinterpretations. The finger heart has also been misconstrued as a Christian cross. ==See also== *Hand heart == References == Category:Hand gestures ","title":"Finger heart"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function D(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(B,[["render",D]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/53.md","filePath":"drive/53.md"}'),H={name:"drive/53.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{E as __pageData,N as default};
